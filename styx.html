                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy body armour on pistol rounds, as these are very important rounds to try win, and body armour is probably the best thing you can buy for 3 main reasons: 1) Having body armour reduces aim punch this is your character flinching when he gets shot this causes your crosshair to jump which makes shooting very difficult, 2) Having body armour can significantly increase the amount of damage you can sustain to the stomach/chest, instead of being kill with 3 stomach shots it can take between 6/7 shots to kill you like that. 3) Unlike utility which is very easy to waste, you can’t really waste armour like you can with utility and if you play well enough you can carry it into the following round and make it cheaper for you.</li>
                    <li>Using weapons at their optimal range, this is a term I use to describe the range at which weapons are most deadly like for example an AWP at long range and a shotgun at close range, now during this match I noticed when you played with the p250 you sometimes engaged with an enemy at a distance outside of the optimal range of pistol leading to incredibly difficult kills and often getting you in trouble.</li>
                    <li>Keep your position as “random” as possible to keep your positional advantage, whenever you force the enemy to look for you, you are giving yourself an advantage in that fight, but if the enemy already knows where you are from you throwing utility or making noise, this can be bad.</li>
                    <li>LOS utility, this got you in trouble a few times this game, this is the practise of throwing risky utility that could potentially lead to you dying to an enemy peeking on a good timing a good way of avoiding this is by focusing on always throwing utility from behind some sort of good cover (cover that can’t be spammed through).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grenade, a weird choice of buy; usually, I recommend going with body armor as there are numerous advantages and it's very difficult to “waste” body armor. Solid grenade into site doing 44 damage to one enemy, unfortunately immediately after you threw it there was an engagement you were not really ready to take. L</li>
                    <li>P250, now with upgraded pistol buys the most important thing is going to be your positioning, and unfortunately, your positioning this round wasn’t good. This led to the enemies immediately spotting you and removing your cover. When you are on a low buy, your first engagement must be super close range; this drastically improves your chances of landing a headshot and makes sure your weapon is doing its max damage. Also, during these rounds, you don’t want to play “standard” positions like headshot pillar; you want to be at an off-angle to try to catch the opponent off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid positioning towards jail. Good job securing two kills as they exited apps, and a nice idea to run over their bodies to pick up utility. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid base molly into apps. If you want to try to mess them up a bit if you hear them deep like you did, you can also try following it up with a deep nade apps. Bad timing on the decision to leave B site as they were coming out apps led to you being caught off-guard twice in a row, resulting in your death. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven buy, nice molly apps, and I like your thought processing with the smoke catwalk. Good movement around site after hearing an enemy drop apps in order to completely catch him off-guard. Really, really good patience on display here to wait for your teammates to peek from cat and take on the last enemy with your team. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, same molly 4 times in a row, starting to use some programming here in play which is good. Nice rotate towards A after realizing your teammates have the bomb. Really clean kill on the enemy jungle, and good decision to not continue peeking jungle in that 1v1 situation. Nice patience and a solid peek to win. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at the deep apps Molly although it didn’t land where you wanted. I saw the potential. Bad jump spot from van leaving you completely open to apps for a long period. I would recommend changing this technique to prevent dying to decent awpers and good riflers in the future. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, positioned jail for a little bit and then rotated to market and A after seeing a lot of enemies towards connector. Solid use of utility with the grenade and Molly, to force him under. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, jail seems to be a bit of a crutch with you spending at least some time here 5 out of 9 rounds, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, if you hold Ctrl while buying it will auto throw; this has 2 advantages. It's faster than the typical method, and if your teammate decides he doesn’t want the weapon, you can still sell it if he is the only one to touch it. If 2 people (including you) touch a weapon you bought, you can’t sell it. Solid aggression into middle to fight with your teammates, but your peek catwalk wasn’t executed correctly. This led to you walking into the enemy chair giving him a huge advantage in this fight. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you being the anchor player, you will be the absolute last person to the other site. But a few times you have left a little preemptively. I really like this flank as you pushed through apps; this was executed perfectly. Unfortunately, when the enemy wasn’t just in front of you like you expected, you froze in a bad position just kind of out in the open in front of Tetris. This allowed the enemy who was CT when he peeked back to make a big adjustment onto you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly, unfortunate spray onto the enemy balcony. Slightly dangerous LOS utility but it worked out as the moment the enemy spotted you with the utility he didn’t shoot and you got the kill. Nice reposition to the empty pillar and solid kill on the enemy site, and then a nice third on the enemy dropping balcony. W</li>
                    <li>P250 molly, as I talked about previously utility it hard to use effectively on pistol rounds. This led to you accidentally molly 3 people (including yourself) for a bit. Nice kill on the enemy CT, but again without having body armor you just got body spammed by the dualies. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10, a good initial spray but unfortunately as you engaged the enemy on Apps balcony, you looked towards site and this allowed the Mag-7 on the balcony to instantly kill you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice smoke towards A, for the Fake. Solid bomb plant default. I really like your patience and how you don’t immediately go for any kill opportunity. Solid peek door after a certain time and although you whiffed your spray you managed to secure the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good kill on the enemy pushing ramp. You got flashed as you pushed out ramp allowing an enemy to peek you from stairs where one of your teammates’ smokes failed leading to you dying. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice window smoke, unfortunate first engagement against an enemy cat to landed and an instant headshot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, LOS smoke into connector which was very dangerous. Never peek an angle for the first time with utility in your hand. Nice kill on the enemy CT but you walked into the angle which wasn’t good, but he also walked into the angle so you just reacted quicker. Nice second kill on the other enemy to win the round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, wasted molly window. Nice kill on the enemy window through the smoke. You keep showing your back towards dangerous angles temporarily. I want you to consistently keep your crosshair on the most dangerous angle at all times. This will drastically reduce the number of times you can be caught off-guard, although it will force you to have better movement and positional awareness. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice smokes on B, although unfortunate flash. Good kill on the enemy window B. W</li>

                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Pretty comfortable and a little cold. </li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>My favourite position is playing triple, although I was perfectly find playing B.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Crosshair was sometimes on the enemy.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I was confident, and I feel like a lot of my flicking was flicking down, spray felt off as I seem to not be able to get the game down quite yet. </li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I think my counter-strafes were pretty good, there were a few times I got a bit overwhelmed and I couldn’t really transfer anything, I usually do a happy medium of adjusting between multiple different peeks. </li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I felt like I didn’t really know when to rotate although I feel like when I did decide to rotate it was at the right time except for one time, I did bump into some walls especially in market window. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I feel like I bought enough, My Molly A messed up and did damage my teammates.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I feel like I was late on some of my calls and I had one bad callout on market when he was bench. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I think figuring out what position I play on T side.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Yea I liked them and they were super serious and competitive. </li>

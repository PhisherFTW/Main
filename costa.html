                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thow less LOS utility.</li>
                    <li>Take more time lining up smaller utility during this game I noticed 6 times that utility didn't land where you wanted and although that is not alot if this isn't addressed this will become a habit.</li>
                    <li>Don't peek an unknown angle with utility in your hand, and take every peek as if an enemy will be there.</li>
                    <li>When playing with a SMG play within its optimal range, numerous times during that match you took gun fights with MP9s and mac-10s with enemies very far away which caused these fights to be very inefficient.</li>
                    <li>I would recommend to try to identify key features of the rounds you win vs the rounds you lose, this will help you break a losing streak of rounds and help you adapt your style if you are having a winning streak.</li>

                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Nuke</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Full util set, small nade miss, opening door with utility in hand is dangerous, good patience waiting for flank, nice kill and good call drop, good shot on the enemy outdoor, really good jiggling to confirm the enemy is off the bomb. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, small Molly fail, good timing on the secret walk, good angle clearing, solid rotation through inside, solid initial kill although slightly hyper-aggressive after missing the kill on the first guy. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid utility onto A, small jump fail, solid rotation through outside, good initial kill in the 2v1, although in the 1v1 situation, you were overpeeking and not playing the bomb and not playing time. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid communication and good stack setup for lobby, flash top silo landed a little deep ontop so anyone holding from mouth or behind blue container wouldn’t have been blind, good quick decision to go up to heaven and although you rushed your first kill a little you still managed to secure it, although your clearing of A site was a little slow and this gave the enemy near site silo time to peek you and kill you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good utility outside and the flash to delay the push, good awareness to hold for the potential aggression, nice utility into ramp to allow your team to get out and take it freely, and good understanding to hold for the potential flank, unfortunately, you decided to flank them which was a little slow to be helpful in your teammates taking the B bombsite, good initial kill on the enemy as you came out of vents, unfortunately, the spray wasn’t with you to transfer to the second. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, interesting peek although you should always be weary of the top ledge as that is going to be the more dangerous position as it heavily favors the CT you can spot the angle by crouching on that peek, good util drop although unfortunate miss on the molly, nice peek out door and solid double kill unfortunate miss on the third. L</li>
                    <li>Save, double flashes, using LOS utility and peeking an angle with utility before clearing it, got you to take a load of damage on the initial flash throw and then due to the damage and the unknown position of the enemy the second flash failed due to panic, nice reactionary dink on the enemy ramp allowing for your teammate to secure a kill. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid peek door although the LOS smoke straight after the miss is dangerous as some players will try to take advantage of the 0.7 second delay after a shot is made. However, the smoke is good as it provides you with some cover and potential to make a play ultimately it does a good job of distracting the player mouth, good patience lobby. Still, you are again so far away from your teammates and the bomb like in round 1 and 5, if they die you cannot defend the bomb or back them up, fortunately, your 2 teammates are beasts and end usp killing 3 of the remaining 4 Ts so you can rotate down vents. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid movement outside although peeks are a little unfocused as it seems like you are scanning through the angles rather than locking in on each one which will delay your reaction slightly, fortunately, no enemy awpers is challenging you, really nice angle from behind red container, unfortunately, you get spotted, this allows the enemy secret to molly you, you think about smoking but decide against it and expose yourself to a peek from the enemy blue container which could have gotten you killed as it seems you weren’t fully ready for an engagement, next after that you take a hyper-aggressive angle deep secret hoping the player blue container doesn’t peek you which is dangerous as you are already one player down and if you go down this round is guaranteed for the enemy, fortunately, you don’t get peeked and you drop a smoke to feign your position outside, allowing you to fall back to lobby, good requests for the utility but the walk peek into door was unfortunate as an enemy awper was holding the angle which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Tec 9 util, nice utility onto A unfortunately it wasn’t enough to keep your teammates alive going down vents, solid movement onto top mouth and fortunately the enemy mouth didn’t hear the drop allowing you to secure the kill on him as he peeked outside, unfortuante engagement against the enemy top rafters, if you had sprayed it would have been a kill but good attempt at tapping. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility towards outside, although after your teammates started dropping in the lobby you felt pressure to find a pick and this caused you to peek top silo into an awp behind blue unfortunately getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9 buy, solid mouth smoke, unfortunate flash miss and a good follow-up flash into mouth allowing your teammates to secure two kills, nice agro peek through the smoke into mouth and good job securing a gun putting your team in a fantastic position in the 3v1. W</li>
                    <li>CT side pistol, Full utility, I understand the molly door but you do not hold the pin pulled on a contact position this is extremely dangerous and against good players they will instantly dink you on this peek if they peek and not rush, good job getting a timing to drop the molly when they do push, but in this situation, you still have a smoke and a flash, instead of continuing the contact you should think about how this utility can benefit the retake as they have taken the site quite well, unfortunately, you push the matter and this gets you punished. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, solid outside utility to delay an early push, nice use of the glave smoke to allow you to get behind red container, keep you crosshair at the position that is the most dangerous to you at any moment, small movement mistake, reloading while jiggling the angle although the enemy has weak weapons this needlessly puts you in danger while providing no benefit, after allowing the enemy to close the distance between you and them this puts you in a really good position to use your smg solid first kill and unfortunate spray on the second enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good util outside and fantastic communication, nice smoke clear with the grenade to get information, solid rotate down ramp and good angle clearing although this was slow as by the time you take your first engagement 22 seconds have passed since the bomb had been planted, this leaves you with only 13 seconds to find the remaining 3 Ts (assuming you kill the first one) and defuse the bomb, unfortunately during this first engagement you moved while shooting which caused you bullets to be inaccurate. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, good util combo door to allow for the agro push lobby with the flashes although it is LOS so it the enemy is in an advanced position door they can kill you instantly, really nice movement around their outside smokes and good job getting the instant flank, good job listening to your teammate and great positioning, unfortunately, the enemy did a jump which caught you off-guard after missing the initial headshot, the next two shots are a miss due to the panic of the enemy turning around. L</li>
                    <li>Grenade/flash, an unfortunate nade miss which forced you to open the door and throw LOS utility, unfortunately, this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, running around trying to use utility is a little dangerous as if the enemies are rushing outside quick you will be exposed to potentially dangerous angles without being able to fight back, good reaction to the enemy peeking secret side, good job falling back to CT after being flashed and good angle hell although I prefer the forklift angle, good calls although dangerous peek as you swing wide into the previous double peek good job securing the kill on the enemy heaven, unfortunately getting traded soon after don’t be afraid to chill remember to keep track of the time just waste theirs. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, movement is a bit hyperactive this round bouncing around from hell to heaven to ramp back to heaven back down to hell, this is good to keep your position unknown to the enemy but can be extremely hard to keep focused while changing angles so often and might lead to accidental overexposure, good kill on the enemy garage, good idea to peek ramp with a flash although it went slightly deep, still had a nice shot, good awareness of the potential position of the last player but playing overly agro and choosing the worst of the 3 potential angles. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, small teammate util damage, good awareness to check the potential position you noticed an enemy in earlier in the game but you decided to check with your Fiveseven at a very far distance while exposing yourself to the whole of outside, unfortunately, this gets you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice flash peek ramp again flash landed a bit deep causing the enemy peeking not to be blind but you did manage to hit a very nice shot, good deep angle ramp holding for the peek and a solid kill, good understanding to make noise when he started planting to push him off it and timing it well with your teammates movement up vents, interesting smoke from heaven. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good early nade and nice peek left side red container, although it was quite wide unfortunately meaning when you missed your shot you were too far away from cover to get safe and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>M4 buy, good positioning and play although you rushed your first engagement as you could have lined up the kill a bit more efficiently and secured a second before dying. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement and peeks coming up secret and good utility, nice spray on the first enemy mouth, unfortunate timing on switching angles from door to hut which caused your following engagement to be extremely difficult. L</li>
                    <li>OT CT Awp buy, nice attempt at looking for an engagement outside, and solid movement down secret usually I would recommend using your Fiveseven at that range coming downstairs as 1 missed shot with the awp and you are guaranteed dead but with the fiveseven there is more room for error, good job calling for the save this round in the 2v4 retake. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good change of position from secret to ramp with the awp it is a much more optimized angle, small amount of molly damage taken, a good kill from lockers to a garage, and nice movement up to heaven with a solid shot onto the enemy single, good reactionary nade on the enemy out hut, unfortunate jump peek into the angle the awper was holding instead of doing a circle strafe you jumped into the angle which allowed the enemy to react more easily. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, after spotting the outside utility, I can appreciate the agro smoke and a good peek on the enemy silo unfortunately the shot missed and the enemy managed to track you through the smoke. L</li>
                    <li>OT T Awp buy, a really nice early pick understanding the angle that I said earlier and securing the kill, quick molly to prevent pushing for the trade, and nice outside flash for the peek which allowed you to spot the enemy behind blue unfortunately you missed the first shot and you repeeked without further utility allowing the awper to secure the kill on you. L</li>

                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LOS utility again(Having utility in your hand when an enemy is peeking you)</li>
                    <li>Being exposed to multiple dangerous angles at once, try only to be exposed to one dangerous angle at a time.</li>
                    <li>Try to only take engagements with weapons at their “optimal” range for shotguns close range and awp/scout long.</li>
                    <li>Try using movement more to your advantage with jiggling and circle strafing to bait out shots and information.</li>
                    <li>When you think you are about to get peeked but you are forced into a corner play slightly more aggressive, this will give you the opportunity to use the angle more if there are multiple opponents as opposed to sitting completely in the corner and getting double peeked.</li>
                </ul>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Overpass</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Flash,smoke,nade, Solid utility combo and a good job having a teammate pickup a kit, good monster flash for the info peek and solid communication, although dropping from heaven there delayed your rotate slightly if it were anymore slow your teammate would have been solo on A, in this case when you already have 3 players on B site and you are heaven try to keep the short rotate option as retaking against glocks is incredibly disadvantageous to CTs due to a number of factors like the glock being better at close range and the limited utility and kits, good job rotating up just in time although holding the long angle with the smoke pulled in your hand is LOS utility, which is dangerous as it gives the enemy an opportunity to shoot you when you can’t shoot back, fortunately they didn’t take this advantage and you were able to get the utility down and assist your teammates with the nade towards banana but you overly exposed yourself when you were holding the bathroom angle and there were more enemies swinging long, solid taps on the enemy that came out long and good job not panicking, nice attempt at the second engagement but unforuantely you felt the disadvantage of buying utility on pistol round which is if they body spam you they only need 3 well placed stomach shots which do 37 damage a shot.</li>
                    <li>Nova armour, good position connector which is a great angle for this weapon, good communication, and good initial trigger discipline but unfortunately your patience was worn thin and took the engagement from Monster when the enemies were running up to the site, even with a headshot at that distance a kill is very very unlikely, I would have recommended following the enemies short instead of focusing on the enemies monster as you would have gotten a closer range engagement sooner and the followup fights would have been much better for that weapon and the likelihood of you being spotted while flanking short is much lower than someone checking monster.</li>
                    <li>Nade, solid nade into Ramp, although I prefer nading from party over the hedge into Ramp as although it is slightly slower you won’t take nearly as much nade damage and it's much safer, unfortunately, you got dealt with instantly as the enemies double naded middle killing you and doing a ton of damage to a teammate.</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting smoke into Fountain, I like it although the peek timing was unfortunate as you ate an enemy nade on quite a normal timing, unfortunately taking 50 damage, good jump spotting, good jump spotting from site and bank for info, interesting change of position to play by the slanted wall outside bathrooms as this is a decent off angle although, with such low hp, it's still a 50/50 fight, a good attempt at backing up your teammates monster with the flash and solid angle onto the site, unfortunately, the retake was a little slow, which allowed the remaining enemy to play time and win.</li>
                    <li>Deagle, a good attempt at the flank pushing up lowers, unfortunate timing on the enemy falling back and checking the movement up the ladder.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice attempt at the early pick into fountain unfortunately the enemy awper was playing along the edge of the smoke and managed to catch you, good call for the save.</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice fountain smoke and the delayed flash and good deep nade into Party, fantastic utility dumping early which allows for more agro plays later on without utility wasting, good communication, unfortunately, while in bathrooms you moved into a more passive angle while holding towards long this allowed more timing in which the enemy long and the enemy enter bathrooms from Middle could double peek you which is unfortunately exactly what happened, if you would have played a slightly more agro angle on long this would have allowed you to take the fight against the long player earlier while still having cover from the enemy moving into bathrooms and there would have been a smaller timing in which they could both peek you.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice smoke and flash towards fountain allowing your teammate to secure a kill, solid peek into lowers, although with your teammates blowing open lowers door it exposes you to any short take from the enemy, good job assisting your teammates getting out of bathrooms and solid jump spotting from A site, good rotate to B after the bomb was spotted, no action.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid utility towards fountain building the habit allows you to start programming the enemies, solid peek down towards lowers, although again your teammate is blowing open the door, if any enemies are fast pushing short you will be in danger due to the close range angles the door being gone exposes you too, which unfortunately gets you killed this round, good job calling it out.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good peek lowers and solid attempt at getting a timing with the opening of the door, but that LOS grenade was not worth it, firstly your wall bang didn’t hit so he wouldn’t have been low hp and secondly bullets will usually always do more damage than grenade in that kind of situation, fortunately, he missed the timing of you peeking with a grenade, and this allowed you to pull out your awp and hold the angle which he ended up peeking into gifting you the kill, a really slow attempt at this retake with 20 seconds passing before the first engagement which gives you ~15 seconds to find the remaining 2 enemies and start defusing the bomb which isn’t a lot when the enemies are playing defensive and have a solid after-plant position, fortunately, the enemies didn’t play time and gave up early engagement which allowed you guys to get the retake with a little time to spare.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid base utility, and although there was a small movement fail in lowers you weren’t peeked, good job getting this trade kill on the enemy playground for your teammate making the numbers even, good jump spotting A site, to allow your teammate to stack B, unfortunately, the teammate with the off-angle wasn’t able to capitalize although the other leave went 1 for 1 which left you in a 1v1 situation, good job jumping down when you knew he was sticking the bomb although, unfortunate engagement good headshot but he had an AK.</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good positioning in Con and solid reaction to the enemy pushing downstairs, really good timing on the push up the connector stairs to catch the enemy awper completely off-guard.</li>
                    <li>T side, p250 smoke and flash, solid setup, nice flash over the fountain to assist your teammates coming up Connector, and nice quick coms after the initial kill to drop back to take B, solid monster smoke, although the wide swing out the monster is always dangerous although with the p250 you do have the range and damage advantage unfortunately on this swing you encountered a double peek with a player playing heaven and headshot which got you instantly killed.</li>
                    <li>Full save, unfortunately, teammate stabs you bringing you down to 28, although really good job finding the gap to get your team onto A site, and even have the opportunity of getting the bomb down. Although you managed to pull out the almost solo win securing a quad kill and winning the round after starting with 28 hp, fantastic.</li>
                    <li>M4 buy, solid nade into Middle, solid job getting the bomb down, and good communication asking for the site smoke, solid kill on the enemy heaven.</li>
                    <li>M4 buy, solid nade and flash towards Middle, nice heaven smoke deep ramp and good pop flash, good molly behind their counter smoke and solid peek onto the enemy peeking bridge.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice nade and awp peek into Middle, good front bathrooms smoke, and good communication for the execute, nice molly and double flash and smoke on the bomb, no action.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice attempt at peeking monster early and good use of a grenade to burst the smoke, solid flashing for teammate to peek lowers and nice flash out lowers for the peek banana unfortunate angle selection with you choosing the further and arguably better angle for the enemy while they just played divider and they managed to secure the kill on you.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, really good peek in lowers and good kill on the enemy peeking, good heaven smoke and solid double monster flash, unfortunate timing on the enemies counter smoke, good movement into short and good job swapping weapons with the lower hp player, nice job securing the kill on the enemy short but bad decision to peek into short after losing the round, that weapon is much more important than potentially another kill and you were peeking into an angle the player was prefiring you through wood into.</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good utility towards B with the early heaven smoke and the double flash over, solid control of bathrooms and banana, and a really nice exec attempt on the A site, although during this round everyone was too far from the action so when your teammate said he had the site, instead of backing him up and further securing it, you assumed the enemies would instantly go for the retake in a 2v4 situation when in-fact they were quite slow which led to them catching your buddy trying to solo take B when you had A which got him killed and put you guys into a 3v2 and then because you didn’t back up your A player he was left in a 1v1 with the player that did rotate and that didn’t go his way which left you guys in a 2v2 situation, and your attempt at taking B, you swung out wide exposing yourself to every angle Graffiti and heaven even after your teammates called it just before you peeked which got you killed, unfortunately leaving your teammate in a 1v2 which he somehow managed to pull off which was amazing.</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a small amount of damage taken early on the drop -8hp, which unfortunately turns the enemy m4 into a better ak, as the m4 is easier to control and only needs 1 headshot to kill you when you have 92hp, just be weary of taking unnesecary damage, which can have profound impacts on your late engagements, good play pushing into Bank and nice job securing that enemy dumpster, well done playing the 1v1 with the prefire, although I would recommend standing slightly off the wall when backed into the corner this makes their crosshair placement slightly more difficult when taking the engagement against you.</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement down Ladder this round, and good early molly allowing you guys to move up connector, unfortunate followup molly failing to go where you wanted, ignoring the top connector peek onto you going out the door which is extremely dangerous fortunately there was no enemy there holding, nice early heaven smoke, LOS grenade into headshot very dangerous but you manage to secure a timing when you didn't get peeked with the grenade, unfortunately, you do get peeked 1 second after you stop holding that angle and get killed.</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting early monster nade although it lands a little shallow for the wood peek, weird off-angle deep monster by barrel although if you have had success with it before, then that is great, good trade kill on the enemy short, but you are pushing out short way too far for your monster player to be of any assistance I know you were using the smoke as cover but by the time you died you could have been peeked from right and left side pillar/headshot and heaven, without the help of your teammate.</li>
                    <li>Tec9 buy, solid heaven smoke/monster flash and B site flash, good timing on the monster push through the smoke and nice attempt at baiting the AK player toxic unfortunately he spammed the wood well killing you.</li>

                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always try to keep within the optimal range of the weapon you are playing with as this will drastically increase the odds of you winning any engagement.</li>
                    <li>Try not to throw LOS utility, as it got you punished during this game.</li>
                    <li>Play more selfishly as you were actively putting yourself in bad positions to assist your teammate with engagements but he was leaving you out to dry.</li>
                    <li>Trust your teammates less, there were two positions where you got in trouble because you trusted your teammates to cover your back without communicating it.</li>
                    <li>Trust yourself more, in the one situation you had the right play in your head but got pressured into make the wrong play by a teammate, unforuatnely losing the 1v1.</li>

                    <li>P250, unfortunately maybe due to your missed jumps the enemies might have heard you going for the boost which is why they checked it, this engagement was also on the edge of the P250 optimal range. L</li>

                    <li>Full buy, good utility towards the elbow, unfortunately, they smoke you off in middle early and push through your utility gaining control, this forces you to fall back, and the enemies go agro all over the map leaving you in a 1v5, good job getting one kill but they were hunting you and quickly traded. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good attempt at taking middle control, unfortunate LOS utility onto short making you take a lot of damage and then you are forced into a predictable angle which the enemies double prefire. L</li>

                    <li>Full buy, a good attempt at supporting your player towards Middle but he is playing hyper-aggressive, damage was taken from the player in the middle, good flash. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice attempt at peeking middle, unfortunately, they realized their mistake and smoked you off, good retake killing the guy A main on the repeek and a fantastic second to get a quick trade and win the round. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol, Smoke flash, unfortunate round with players in middle dying early leaving you in a 2v5, and then being forced out of the optimal range of the glock in the duel on A, with the enemy winning this engagement. L</li>

                  <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                  <ul>
                      <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>A bit tired</li>
                      <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I do usually play middle, although I probably haven’t played it in a while, I found that I went to donut when I didn’t have util.</li>
                      <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I felt like my crosshair placement was alright but my engagements were letting me down, I was aiming in the right area but I couldn’t kill anyone in that game.</li>
                      <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I guess the spray is apart of the poor engagements.</li>
                      <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I tried to peek where the player would be most of the time and with the correct crosshair placement.</li>
                      <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I suppose my pathing could have been better when going long, The only movement mistake was missed jump.</li>
                      <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I feel like my utility wasn’t bad, and T side utility I missed a molly cheetah but that was okay.</li>
                      <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I feel like there were instances where it was good, but after I started going back and forth with that guy communication started to dwindle.</li>
                      <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Be a bit more selfish and not try and overly compromise for my teammates. </li>
                      <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>The others were okay.</li>

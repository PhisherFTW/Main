                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thow less LOS utility.</li>
                    <li>Take more time lining up smaller utility during this game I noticed 6 times that utility didn't land where you wanted and although that is not alot if this isn't addressed this will become a habit.</li>
                    <li>Don't peek an unknown angle with utility in your hand, and take every peek as if an enemy will be there.</li>
                    <li>When playing with a SMG play within its optimal range, numerous times during that match you took gun fights with MP9s and mac-10s with enemies very far away which caused these fights to be very inefficient.</li>
                    <li>I would recommend to try to identify key features of the rounds you win vs the rounds you lose, this will help you break a losing streak of rounds and help you adapt your style if you are having a winning streak.</li>

                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Nuke</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Full util set, small nade miss, opening door with utility in hand is dangerous, good patience waiting for flank, nice kill and good call drop, good shot on the enemy outdoor, really good jiggling to confirm the enemy is off the bomb. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, small Molly fail, good timing on the secret walk, good angle clearing, solid rotation through inside, solid initial kill although slightly hyper-aggressive after missing the kill on the first guy. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid utility onto A, small jump fail, solid rotation through outside, good initial kill in the 2v1, although in the 1v1 situation, you were overpeeking and not playing the bomb and not playing time. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid communication and good stack setup for lobby, flash top silo landed a little deep ontop so anyone holding from mouth or behind blue container wouldn’t have been blind, good quick decision to go up to heaven and although you rushed your first kill a little you still managed to secure it, although your clearing of A site was a little slow and this gave the enemy near site silo time to peek you and kill you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good utility outside and the flash to delay the push, good awareness to hold for the potential aggression, nice utility into ramp to allow your team to get out and take it freely, and good understanding to hold for the potential flank, unfortunately, you decided to flank them which was a little slow to be helpful in your teammates taking the B bombsite, good initial kill on the enemy as you came out of vents, unfortunately, the spray wasn’t with you to transfer to the second. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, interesting peek although you should always be weary of the top ledge as that is going to be the more dangerous position as it heavily favors the CT you can spot the angle by crouching on that peek, good util drop although unfortunate miss on the molly, nice peek out door and solid double kill unfortunate miss on the third. L</li>
                    <li>Save, double flashes, using LOS utility and peeking an angle with utility before clearing it, got you to take a load of damage on the initial flash throw and then due to the damage and the unknown position of the enemy the second flash failed due to panic, nice reactionary dink on the enemy ramp allowing for your teammate to secure a kill. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid peek door although the LOS smoke straight after the miss is dangerous as some players will try to take advantage of the 0.7 second delay after a shot is made. However, the smoke is good as it provides you with some cover and potential to make a play ultimately it does a good job of distracting the player mouth, good patience lobby. Still, you are again so far away from your teammates and the bomb like in round 1 and 5, if they die you cannot defend the bomb or back them up, fortunately, your 2 teammates are beasts and end usp killing 3 of the remaining 4 Ts so you can rotate down vents. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid movement outside although peeks are a little unfocused as it seems like you are scanning through the angles rather than locking in on each one which will delay your reaction slightly, fortunately, no enemy awpers is challenging you, really nice angle from behind red container, unfortunately, you get spotted, this allows the enemy secret to molly you, you think about smoking but decide against it and expose yourself to a peek from the enemy blue container which could have gotten you killed as it seems you weren’t fully ready for an engagement, next after that you take a hyper-aggressive angle deep secret hoping the player blue container doesn’t peek you which is dangerous as you are already one player down and if you go down this round is guaranteed for the enemy, fortunately, you don’t get peeked and you drop a smoke to feign your position outside, allowing you to fall back to lobby, good requests for the utility but the walk peek into door was unfortunate as an enemy awper was holding the angle which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Tec 9 util, nice utility onto A unfortunately it wasn’t enough to keep your teammates alive going down vents, solid movement onto top mouth and fortunately the enemy mouth didn’t hear the drop allowing you to secure the kill on him as he peeked outside, unfortuante engagement against the enemy top rafters, if you had sprayed it would have been a kill but good attempt at tapping. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility towards outside, although after your teammates started dropping in the lobby you felt pressure to find a pick and this caused you to peek top silo into an awp behind blue unfortunately getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9 buy, solid mouth smoke, unfortunate flash miss and a good follow-up flash into mouth allowing your teammates to secure two kills, nice agro peek through the smoke into mouth and good job securing a gun putting your team in a fantastic position in the 3v1. W</li>
                    <li>CT side pistol, Full utility, I understand the molly door but you do not hold the pin pulled on a contact position this is extremely dangerous and against good players they will instantly dink you on this peek if they peek and not rush, good job getting a timing to drop the molly when they do push, but in this situation, you still have a smoke and a flash, instead of continuing the contact you should think about how this utility can benefit the retake as they have taken the site quite well, unfortunately, you push the matter and this gets you punished. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, solid outside utility to delay an early push, nice use of the glave smoke to allow you to get behind red container, keep you crosshair at the position that is the most dangerous to you at any moment, small movement mistake, reloading while jiggling the angle although the enemy has weak weapons this needlessly puts you in danger while providing no benefit, after allowing the enemy to close the distance between you and them this puts you in a really good position to use your smg solid first kill and unfortunate spray on the second enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good util outside and fantastic communication, nice smoke clear with the grenade to get information, solid rotate down ramp and good angle clearing although this was slow as by the time you take your first engagement 22 seconds have passed since the bomb had been planted, this leaves you with only 13 seconds to find the remaining 3 Ts (assuming you kill the first one) and defuse the bomb, unfortunately during this first engagement you moved while shooting which caused you bullets to be inaccurate. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, good util combo door to allow for the agro push lobby with the flashes although it is LOS so it the enemy is in an advanced position door they can kill you instantly, really nice movement around their outside smokes and good job getting the instant flank, good job listening to your teammate and great positioning, unfortunately, the enemy did a jump which caught you off-guard after missing the initial headshot, the next two shots are a miss due to the panic of the enemy turning around. L</li>
                    <li>Grenade/flash, an unfortunate nade miss which forced you to open the door and throw LOS utility, unfortunately, this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, running around trying to use utility is a little dangerous as if the enemies are rushing outside quick you will be exposed to potentially dangerous angles without being able to fight back, good reaction to the enemy peeking secret side, good job falling back to CT after being flashed and good angle hell although I prefer the forklift angle, good calls although dangerous peek as you swing wide into the previous double peek good job securing the kill on the enemy heaven, unfortunately getting traded soon after don’t be afraid to chill remember to keep track of the time just waste theirs. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, movement is a bit hyperactive this round bouncing around from hell to heaven to ramp back to heaven back down to hell, this is good to keep your position unknown to the enemy but can be extremely hard to keep focused while changing angles so often and might lead to accidental overexposure, good kill on the enemy garage, good idea to peek ramp with a flash although it went slightly deep, still had a nice shot, good awareness of the potential position of the last player but playing overly agro and choosing the worst of the 3 potential angles. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, small teammate util damage, good awareness to check the potential position you noticed an enemy in earlier in the game but you decided to check with your Fiveseven at a very far distance while exposing yourself to the whole of outside, unfortunately, this gets you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice flash peek ramp again flash landed a bit deep causing the enemy peeking not to be blind but you did manage to hit a very nice shot, good deep angle ramp holding for the peek and a solid kill, good understanding to make noise when he started planting to push him off it and timing it well with your teammates movement up vents, interesting smoke from heaven. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good early nade and nice peek left side red container, although it was quite wide unfortunately meaning when you missed your shot you were too far away from cover to get safe and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>M4 buy, good positioning and play although you rushed your first engagement as you could have lined up the kill a bit more efficiently and secured a second before dying. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement and peeks coming up secret and good utility, nice spray on the first enemy mouth, unfortunate timing on switching angles from door to hut which caused your following engagement to be extremely difficult. L</li>
                    <li>OT CT Awp buy, nice attempt at looking for an engagement outside, and solid movement down secret usually I would recommend using your Fiveseven at that range coming downstairs as 1 missed shot with the awp and you are guaranteed dead but with the fiveseven there is more room for error, good job calling for the save this round in the 2v4 retake. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good change of position from secret to ramp with the awp it is a much more optimized angle, small amount of molly damage taken, a good kill from lockers to a garage, and nice movement up to heaven with a solid shot onto the enemy single, good reactionary nade on the enemy out hut, unfortunate jump peek into the angle the awper was holding instead of doing a circle strafe you jumped into the angle which allowed the enemy to react more easily. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, after spotting the outside utility, I can appreciate the agro smoke and a good peek on the enemy silo unfortunately the shot missed and the enemy managed to track you through the smoke. L</li>
                    <li>OT T Awp buy, a really nice early pick understanding the angle that I said earlier and securing the kill, quick molly to prevent pushing for the trade, and nice outside flash for the peek which allowed you to spot the enemy behind blue unfortunately you missed the first shot and you repeeked without further utility allowing the awper to secure the kill on you. L</li>
                  </ol>

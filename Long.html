                <h3>What we went through and focus areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on putting yourself in a position to trade teammates or have them trade you instead of trying to go solo</li>
                    <li>When holding a corner make sure to position your crosshair a fair distance from the corner and try to imagine what kind of peek the enemy will most likely do against you.</li>
                    <li>Always point your crosshair at the next most likely position for an enemy to peek you from even if you are falling back and think they probably won't peek</li>
                    <li>Try to take advantage of each sides advantages like T side: Weaponry Advantage / Peekers advantage and CT sides: Positional advantage / Holding advantage</li>
                    <li>Different molly lineup for top banana which is more effective and safer</li>
                    <li>When playing against pistols its important to try maintain and keep your distance because the closer you get to them the more dangeorus they become.</li>
                    <li>When playing with the USP try to keep your distance and use its insanely good accuracy to your advantage by tapping</li>
                    <li>When playing with the Famas try playing it like its an upgraded SMG as you will have alot more success like that because the Famas is by far the weakest rifle and trying to take long range fights will be difficult</li>
                    <li>Learn the quickest timings someone can be at a location as sometimes during that game you dropped utility when it was impossible for the enemy to actually be there.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower your sens to 1 ingame and 800dpi</li>
                    <li>Practise with the Routine provided for a minimum of 1 month before making changes</li>
                    <li>Try to play at least 1 comp per day and make sure you properly warmup before every game</li>
                    <li>Focus on improving 1 skill or 1 smart GOAL at a time till you have it at your desired level then move onto the next while maintaining it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Community FFA Deathmatch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large flicks are imprecise often largely over-flicking enemies positions</li>
                    <li>micro adjustments are incredibly hard because of the higher sensitivtiy and you look uncomfortable fighting at range</li>
                    <li>Overly relying on crouching whenever spraying an enemy makes you an easy target</li>
                    <li>Often starts shooting before the crosshair is locked onto an enemy</li>
                    <li>Raw point click aim is pretty good but would benefit greatly from decreasing sensitivtiy</li>
                    <li>Sometimes does a "style" flick after getting a kill as some awpers do which isn't necessarily bad but it can get you punished especially with a rifle</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Armour, Good crosshair placement moving up second middle, solid kill on the enemy pushing through the arch smoke and fantastic reactions to get the enemy pushing lane behind you and nice flick onto the guy coming out apps, fantastic reposition to completely catch the last guy coming up lane off-guard and overall a fantastic 4k and clutch. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression and molly into apps although you are taking a lot of solo engagements and pushing into positions by yourself, nice peek from boiler onto the enemy lane and good preaim and crosshair placement, solid pathing onto site and unfortunately you got killed from a good off-angle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flash top middle, interesting molly top banana but it still leaves room for an enemy to peek behind it, solid angle clearing to kill the enemy close wall top banana but unfortunately your teammates were not close enough to trade your death you were a bit too far ahead of them. W</li>
                    <li>no buy, internet dropped, missed the round. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy,  internet dropped again, L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, stream came on late, unfortunate timing led to you being flanked in Mexico which led to you dying. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job holding the push stairs apps but your crosshair was too close to the corner if an enemy did peek the stairs you would have to flick in order to get the kill, the enemy was sitting on the stairs with a Mag7 which managed to instantly kill you unfortunately you were too far from your teammates to allow them to get a trade kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, when getting out Mexico you didn’t look towards the danger top middle which could have easily gotten you killed you should always look at the first point of possible contact so if an enemy does peek you can at least fight back, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice window flash banana, Good angle clearing apps although its still very dangerous to do it alone, good rotate to banana without making a lot of noise, nice flash into CT, do not give away your positional advantage(enemy not knowing your position) for free as once they know where you are hiding it makes their job a lot easier. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at backing up your teammate apps but you should have tried to be closer so you could attempt a trade while he was still being shot at unfortunately you were just a bit late which allowed the 2 enemies in apps to refocus their attention onto you which allowed them to kill you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at mollying top banana but the molly you throw can leave a gap behind it which can allow the enemy to still peek banana, nice reaction to kill the enemy pushing down banana and nice preaim and attempted prefire to get the awper on the corner holding you, good attempt at hunting down the awper. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice nade banana, unfortunate timing on the push through the bottom banana smoke which got you killed by the enemy sitting top banana with a awp. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice kill top banana but very dangerous peek as you pushed close against pistols and had no one to trade you, good patience waiting for the top banana smoke to fade fortunately when it did an unaware enemy pushed through and you managed to clean him up, fantastic round overall as you managed to keep pushing and peeking into angles the enemies were not aware of and it allowed to you get an ace. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice nade kill top banana, but you were overly aggressive after you thought it was clear which got you killed by the third enemy who was there with a shotgun. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice window flash banana, you were extremely uncomfortable in your positioning bottom middle once second middle was compromised I would recommend going to backup your teammate and regain map control because he ended up pushing banana alone and died without anyone to trade him. L</li>
                    <li>CT armour, nice attempt at catching the enemy jumping out apps unfortunately you peeks following that engagement were what got you killed as you paniced and tried to spray the USP like it was a glock which got you dinked and tagged by the enemy with the tec-9. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, good job getting 1 kill against SMGS, you did your job. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice position arch unfortunately committing to the spray is a dangerous play as it took you slightly too long to get the first kill and once you did the second enemy knew your exact position and this allow them to kill you but not before you did a good amount of damage. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, when playing with the famas I recommend close to medium ranges as it is by far the weakest of all the rifles in the game, you should play it like its an upgraded SMG and you will find a lot more success like this, unfortunately, you got overly aggressive and pushed down middle but that was okay since it was a 5v1. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice headshot position on A site looking into apps I really like this position as it is not commonly played and this allowed you to secure an easy kill but unfortunately after you made this really good play you spent too much time changing positions out in the open which got you traded by a second enemy in apps. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, Molly dropped apps was too early and was wasted as it was finished by the time the enemies actually came, nice kill from belcony into apps but I will show you superior positions and how you should hold apps from pit, you started holding long when it was your job to hold apps and this got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice position pit but you played it dangerously and incorrectly sometimes, pit is by far one of the most powerful positions on A site and anytime you can fight and enemy from pit the fight is heavily in your favor. L</li>
                    <li>P250, nice kill from construction on B against the AK, and good attempt at getting the second kill but there wasn’t much more you could do as you were low and had no armour. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice banana flash, weird rotations from coffins back to CT after there seemed to be an exec, fortunately the enemies did not commit to B otherwise this would have been a bad mistake, unfortunate over flick on the enemy site which caused you to miss his head but your spray managed to bring it back to an almost kill, I would recommend lowering your sens so this types of flicks happen less. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, the constantly changing of positions left you out in unknown territory multiple times which was very dangerous and it eventually punished you as there were no teammates holding brackets or long which they eventually pushed. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice flashes top banana allowing your teammate to get a pick down banana, slight smoke mistake dropping it early, your positioning was dangerous but you had a very nice flick on the enemy arch which fortunately was below 40 hp. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, during this round you gave away your positional advantage which allowed the enemies to attack you from multiple sides good job getting 1 kill but if you would have stayed hidden longer you could have secured at least 2. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting position on A and I personally think its a very dangerous position as it is often preferred </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game? <br> Yes, T side was comfortable but I was not comfortable in the second half as my teammates started flaming me.</li>
                    <li>How did you crosshair placement feel? <br> I didn't really focus on that during this game so I can't say</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel? <br> First half was really good and confident but second half overall was quite slow</li>
                    <li>How did you positioning feel? <br> Felt like I usually put myself in advantageoous posiitions</li>
                    <li>How did you utility feel? <br> Utility felt alright but limited on T side due to teamamtes computer</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> Nope.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Flash and use smokes more consistently</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing passive angles reduced the number of engagements you were left with, but overall positioning was quite strong just not a lot of action.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes accidentally turning your back towards a dangerous angle always focused on keeping your crosshair on the position that is most dangerous to you even when rotating.</li>
                    <li>Not clearing all angles properly overlooking some common angles line boiler and lane during retakes and takes.</li>
                    <li>Some small spray whiffs, but overall nothing really to worry about.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spraying could use some work as you look quite uncomfortable at medium to close range.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>

                    <li>MP9 buy, good molly up second middle into apps, nice callouts for the possible middle push, nice angle clearing as you moved out onto A, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good patience when holding for the aggression apps, good use of smoke for arches, unfortunately, overlooked the close lane angle which caused you to flick far past the enemy. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice nade top banana, good communication on the potential position of the enemy, solid kill on the enemy family, unfortunately getting quickly traded by the enemy CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good idea offering the boost once you and your teammate were forced up banana, throwing LOS utility towards CT which nearly got you punished, peeking towards top banana unfocused which allowed the enemy to catch you completely off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, timeout, nice window flash, and solid top banana molly, good job clearing sandbags, good job clearing church, although a small spray whiff caused you to not secure this kill initially, then going for the repeek you get the kill but quickly get traded. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life? <br>well its not perfect, but its the most comfortable setup for me and I am physically I felt good.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played? <br>I have been trying to vary things up and my preferred position is pit and Apps, but I can go B as well.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I don’t think its perfect, I think I did a lot of spraying and a lot of flicking and I don’t think the flicking adjustment was that big.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br>Since I have lowered my sens and been doing your routine, I feel confident flicking, most of the time I think I got the gun under control.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T sides?<br>To be on T side, I didn’t get involved with much fighting, but generally, my peeking wasn’t the best on T side, about the peek, most of them felt obvious as I peeked at a default angle and some of it was a normal peek and some crouch peeking.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br>The thing is the first few rounds we lost A constantly and I kept sitting in No-mans land and being a bit indecisive, and bumped into a few walls.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>There was 1 round when I was in pit where I accidentally flashed myself, but overall I think my utility was pretty standard and I was following the procedure. </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information in a timely manner?<br>my callouts was fine but when I look back at it I don’t think it was very effective as I think there were 2 teammates who didn’t speak English, and 2 teammates who die super early in the round.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>If I were to go B I would communicate with my partner more.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again?<br>I get along with all my teammates, but I don’t think I would play with them again as communication was hard. </li>

                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sometimes shooting before your crosshair is on the enemy</li>
                    <li>Also sometimes trying to shoot too quickly causing your first bullet to not be fully accurate.</li>
                    <li>Alot of forward engagements meaning you are going into the fight with “W” and this is forcing you to counter-strafe with “S” which is extremely unnatural try to crabwalk more often so the majority of your fights are sideways.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t rely on crouching when engaging an enemy as it makes you a slow more obvious target, while not improving your accuracy unless you are tapping.</li>
                    <li>Try to focus on learning contact timings and the fastest possible position an enemy could be in this can reduce wasted utility and unnecessary angle clearing as well as allowing you to pull of slightly more risky plays.</li>
                    <li>During full saves/light buys there are 2 main ways to consistently get kills, choose positions that are often overlooked and hope the enemy runs past you, or choose super close-range angles where your first fight with the enemy is right in front of your this will give you the biggest chance of landing a headshot and it allows your weaker weapon to do its max damage.</li>
                    <li>Make sure when you are spraying you are standing completely still 3 times during this game you were moving slightly which caused the first part of your spray to be slightly inaccurate making it take you way longer to get the kill than if you were standing dead still.</li>
                    <li>Trigger discipline is a fantastic skills but its incredibly hard to hone as it comes to us so rarely you get very few chances to practise this, patience is key although always try to make the most of every situation as the difference between getting a single/double/triple kill when it comes to trigger discipline is often less than 4 seconds.</li>
                    <li>When choosing after-plant positions on T side there are a few factors I want you to think about, when playing to win a round we can do it in 2 ways, either the bomb explodes or you kill the entire enemy team, choose a position that will allow you to win in both ways, you can get some good peeks and you are not just stuck in an obvious corner, as well as playing time (Even better if you can drop utility on the bomb) some obvious examples for this are short on B OR Bathrooms on A in Overpass, these are great because it allows you to defend the bomb while still wasting time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Note layout:</p>
                <p>Round.Weapon buy, Notes, Win or lose</p>
                <p>Map: Overpass <br>Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>P2k armour, early peek middle, great info gathering and good comms, nice attempt at engaging an enemy lowers, unfortunately, you crouched which made moving very difficult during pistol rounds the advantage you have against a Deagle is your moving accuracy and your speed of movement (also if they have a Deagle they likely don’t have body armour so try spamming their body a bit and if you see a lot of blood this shows they don’t have armour). L</li>
                    <li>Pistol buy, getting instantly killed toxic by an enemy-rushing monster. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice short molly, and good short control, nice movement into lowers and up into bathrooms, I would have recommended staying lowers instead of going bathrooms as this completely cuts of their rotation if they wanted to fortunately they decided to just push long and got killed by your 2 teammates on site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid smoke short but your flash was a waste as the enemies have no chance of being short at that time, I would recommend throwing an entry flash onto short instead. Unfortunately, you lagged out this round after gaining short control. L</li>
                    <li>full save, solid positioning to engage in close range fights lowers but peeking deep lowers wasn’t an ideal decision as you are taking a longer range fight than necessary, solid damage but unfortunately, you got killed, your teammate managed to trade your death though. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid smoke short and again throwing the early flash, good attempt at using the short entry flash but it got messed up a little, good quick rotation up to A after immediately spotting the enemies pushing long. Unfortunately lagged out again. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven utility, good quick rotate up to A and solid flash to assist your teammate on Site, good initial kill, unfortunately, due to a bad call you look banana instead of long allowing the enemy long to get a kill on you although you almost had a good flick. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly short and good control, early rotate towards A and giving up short control on a feeling even though no enemies have been spotted yet, solid positioning Optimus, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, whiffed spray, although you managed to get one you were moving while spraying which threw off your aim significantly, unfortunately leading to you dying early. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven, nice confident peek middle, great adjustment onto the enemy party securing that kill, good play to go for the flank from lowers through middle, but they were expecting that and this allowed them to secure the kill on you as you walked into the angle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly into monster, good initial kill on the enemy out monster and solid damage on 2 more, good job staying alive for so long. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid smoke short, wasted flash again, nice agro peeking into monster from short to get info, nice timing on the peek on the enemy lowers to secure the kill. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, really nice quick movement into B through monster, good positioning graffiti if you would have had a little more trigger discipline you could have secured 2 kills. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement through monster and solid angle clearing although your peek on the enemy graffiti wasn’t executed correctly and your spray whiffed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting aggression into Monster solo, unfortunate timing on getting peeked by an enemy close wood. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement onto short and good movement into bathrooms and up to B although your positioning right next to APC wasn’t ideal, an unfortunate peek on the enemy bank wasn’t necessary and the spray whiff is what caused you to lose this engagement. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9, I like your confident peeking on the enemy water, unfortunately, there was also one graffiti which distracted you for a second when the water enemy peeked. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice short take and good timing on the lowers peek to allow you to assist in killing the enemy lowers, nice off angle while holding short aggression, disconnected. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, interesting flash over short and nice distraction flash into monster, nice upgrade to the m4 on the enemy lowers, no action. W</li>
                    <li>M4 Buy, nice aggressive monster and B take and good positioning graphitti, solid change of positions to water after realizing no one was coming heaven or graphitti, solid kill on the enemy bridge. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid short take and good aggression up lowers but unfortunately, you didn’t clear the close right angle as you came up the stairs, this led to you dying but you were quickly traded. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid entry pathing out monster, although you jumping around site caused your first bullets to be inaccurate. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life? <br>A bit uncomfortable on the new maps and the FPS</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played? <br>I am comfortable playing B short and I feel happy there and I know what I am doing.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>It was never on the enemy.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br>I think that game, my flick didn't feel that great and I feel like they were getting the better of me because I was missing my shots. M4 spray felt fine although the AK spray didn’t feel quite right. </li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T sides?<br>Tilted peeking a lot and quite hungry for the kill and I was peeking when I shouldn’t have peeked.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br>Movement-wise my counter-strafing wasn’t that good and moving around the map was quite difficult for me and I blame the fps and rotating-wise, I think that because I was so tilted that I kind of jumped the gun when it came to rotating. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>My utility game was not that great.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information in a timely manner?<br>I think this game my communication was not half bad, and we were communicating instead of flaming each other.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>up my utility game a bit and learn a few smokes and flashes.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again?<br>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again?</li>

                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="">Video (NA)</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn new sprays for M4 and AK; you still look quite uncomfortable in medium-range engagements, often opting for bursting over spraying, which allows the enemy more time to react and slows down your time to kill.</li>
                    <li>Improve your large adjustments; when doing large swipes, you don’t seem to have a lot of control of your crosshair. Sometimes it goes to the ground or very high (this could also be a grip thing). I recommend playing deathmatch; this will make you more comfortable with 180 / 90 degree turns and make more of your mousepad more comfortable.</li>
                    <li>Stick close to cover whenever you have the option. There were moments during this game where you chose to stand out in the open. This basically leaves the engagement choice up to the enemy. If you want to hide or play time and pick an open position, you are kind of stuck, and against players who know how to jiggle peek and prefire, playing open positions will usually get you caught out.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you think you are about to engage in a fight, make sure you have enough ammo to take the engagement. There is nothing worse than running out of bullets midway through a fight you are winning.</li>
                    <li>Throwing default nades early into the round can be fantastic for conditioning the enemies and making them play a certain way. But make sure that the default utility you throw does not actively disadvantage you later on, like leaving you a flash short when trying to entry short.</li>
                    <li>When taking connector control, make sure you clear your corners. During this game, you only died once to an enemy being in one of the corners, but still building those habits is crucial and will get you kills in the future.</li>
                    <li>Practice that short flash on CT side so it lands correctly 90% of the time.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quite a bit of discomfort with spraying even at close to medium ranges,</li>
                    <li>Large adjustments are still quite inaccurate so if an enemy is more than 90 degrees to either of your sides usually you will largely over flick or under flick (Deathmatch improves this.)</li>
                    <li>A somewhat overreliance on short burst (2-3 bullets) this leads you to many situations when you had the advantage in the fight and due to you stopping your burst allowed the enemy to turn on you and kill you.</li>
                    <li>Confidence looks significantly better with the AK vs the M4a1 in terms of fights and engagements.</li>
                </ul>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Overpass <br>Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, Good job backing up your teammate middle and securing the kill on the enemy lowers, solid tapping on the enemy dumpster as you come up to A site, solid positioning although I would have preferred if you stayed closer to cover at some point you were fully exposed. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, solid pathing towards middle, and a nice flash, although I still recommend throwing the middle flash at the bottom of the stairs instead of the top, really nice confident peeking into middle killing the shotgun slower close, and good spray on the enemy lowers, I like the quick movement up towards A site, but I would have recommended reloading before entering as you knew there was an enemy on site, unfortunately, you ran out of ammo but your teammate had your back and managed to get the trade. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice short take although I would recommend the tunnel short flash instead of the one over the top, nice movement, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again using your only flash to flash over short early, I would recommend the tunnel short flash again and unfortunately, you got killed by the players boosting bridge. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again using your only early flash over short instead of a good monster/short flash, not using your utility to cover potential angles instead you got stuck between short and graffiti and this got you killed while flicking between them. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again only flash above short, weird short positioning on the ramp looking towards lowers, as this particular fight doesn’t give you much of an advantage if the enemies know how to peek, really nice initial kill on the enemy running out lowers door, and then a solid second kill unfortunately after those two engagements, you were low hp and your third engagement killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Tec-9 buy, nice movement into connector but didn’t check the close right angle coming up connector or the close right angle top stairs, which unfortunately had an enemy awper who killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement through party and nice spray kill on the enemy bathroom, you could have used your nade or molly in an attempt to push the enemies out of cover and make your engagements easier, unfortunately, you peeked them while they were ready for you and this got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, late push onto B as your teammates left bomb, good job using your smoke on short and good job not rushing to plant the bomb, really good hyper-aggression peek onto the enemy heaven doing something he wasn’t expecting causing him to miss and allowing you to get the spray kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again didn’t flash into short and as you peeked out tunnels the enemy was already close with the pistol who killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid trade timing, but bad galiel spray fortunately you were able to land the kill, unfortunately as you moved towards party an enemy flanking killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unlucky peek timing as you were coming out monster checking the close right angle as the shotgun behind wood decided to peek you. L</li>
                    <li>CT armour, solid kill on the enemy towards A site although a bit panicky in the shooting as you were shooting slightly too quickly for your usp to reset to full accuracy. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, Missed monster molly, unfortunately, it bounced up into the air, nice kill. L</li>
                    <li>PP bison, nice short molly and good protocols to smoke the tunnel, solid movement up lowers and nice timing to nearly flank the enemy bathrooms but unfortunately an enemy late middle came and killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly short although your positioning when you thought they were pushing monster was a bit dangerous as you were hiding behind the pillar, really nice peek and kill on the enemy short, and good attempt at the retake unfortunately your first engagement didn’t go your way as it seemed you were not ready for the fight just yet. L</li>
                    <li>P250, nice lowers aggression first time this half, and there was no one there allowing you to get a really solid flank, fantastic trigger discipline and really nice double kill, good calm tapping. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly short and good control, I liked the thought process behind peeking, but it wasn’t executed correctly which allowed the enemies to have enough time to flick back and shoot at you. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, really nice aggressive peek on the enemy tunnels, a little overly aggressive peeking lowers like that as it's outside the optimal range of the smg but that is okay you did some solid damage before dying. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid short take but the flash failed you threw it from too far back on the bridge, I liked the use of the grenade to break the smoke B tunnels to allow you to peek into monster, solid movement up lowers although the headshot angle is probably better than the off-angle top bench, solid patience till the last enemy was spotted. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly, flash failed again, solid positioning on B to catch the enemies pushing out short while being monster off-guard, very good job not going overly aggressive and peeking too much, perfectly played. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid short take again and good reaction to kill an enemy on site, and retreat to short and assist with a second, after spotting the enemy falling back to monster you chased him allowing you to get the flank on 2 enemies leading to you getting a triple. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, used the wrong utility (flash instead of molly) which allowed the enemy short to push out quickly which caught you slightly off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid kill on the enemy party, unfortunately, there was an enemy lowers who ended up catching you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>OTr1CT, Full buy, Solid short take but didn’t clear tunnels so when you went to peek lowers and the molly faded the tunnels player was able to peek and kill you. L</li>
                    <li>OTr2CT, FUll buy, solid short take, you cleared tunnels this time before peeking lowers which was good, really good flank on the enemies banana, managing to get behind 2 of them, good job playing time in the 1v1 situation. W</li>
                    <li>OTr3CT, Full buy, good short take and clearing tunnels before quickly rotating up towards A, somehow nobody was on A, solid positioning behind Optimus, and good kill, unfortunately, the awper long was ready for your peek and killed you when you did. L</li>
                    <li>OTr4T, Full buy, failed flash over short, I still recommend flashing through tunnels instead, really nice nade into headshot from behind sandbags, good job managing to secure two kills from that position, unfortunately, they ended up trading you. L</li>
                    <li>OTr5T, Full buy flash over again, good job being ready for the boost and nice use of smoke breaking to clear the short smokes to allow you to see better, really nice kill on the enemy short after falling back and solid damage on the awper lowers. W</li>
                    <li>OTr6T, Full buy, really nice use of smoke break to catch an enemy using pillar as cover completely off-guard, be weary of the solo Boost short when spraying your smoke. W TIE</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>I am a bit thirsty.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I think I was happy with short.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>It felt fairly okay, it didnt’ feel too bad but not perfect either.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I think my flick is rather okay this game, there were some times when my crosshair was way off and I managed to flick into the enemy.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>On T side to be honest, I think that I am more conscious about my peeks depending on what weapon I am peeking, and on CT side I am trying different techniques.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I think my rotation this game was fair, there were a few rounds on CT side where my teammate died on A so I would rotate a bit too early, I think my overall rotation felt on point, I didn’t notice any movement mistakes.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I think I landed most of my utility correctly and on T side I think my smoke game is off as I don’t know all of the lineups but I think overall my utility is fairly on point.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>Time wise I think I call it as soon as I hear it, and I don’t think my accuracy was perfect. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Self awareness and being away of my positioning and deciding on what angles to check and how to move throughout the map.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Yea, if I found them they are very okay, I think they started warming up to me at the end.</li>

                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be weary when playing behind smokes as some positions are more obvious to spam than others.</li>
                    <li>Try to be more aware of your minimap, a few times during this game you got caught off-guard of flanked when you didn't expect it as your teammates were in the area but not holding the angle.</li>
                    <li>Try to keep your peeks tight whenever possible to avoid overexposing yourself to multiple angles.</li>
                    <li>Always be weary of making noise as it travels alot further than some might think and can cause you to lose your postitional advantage.</li>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Inferno</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, very good shots on the enemy top banana although I recommend running up the right side of banana to force the enemy to peek wider in order to take the fight against you. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, nice aggression towards top banana, I really like the initiative although slightly over-aggressive once you gained top banana control unless you are fully committing to a rush, I recommend securing each location you gain access to, good kill on the enemy close first oranges with dualies and good rotation back towards A, solid damage on the enemy arches although the mac-10 wasn’t the best weapon for this fight. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, great positioning choice to go apps, this encompasses close-range engagements which is perfect, I really like the flash peek along corridor, unfortunately the enemy was agro and when into the apartment which caught you off-guard allowing him to secure the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, the max number of people who can hold a bought gun before it is sold is 2 this includes yourself, nice try peeking into banana to trade the kill on your teammate but unfortunately, you moved into a predictable angle behind the smoke which ended up getting you spammed. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 armour, good job choosing apps again as it is a close-range angle, as you jumped out apps you were hyper-focused on Pit/balcony and the enemy was on site who was shooting at you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice molly second middle into apps, small movement mistake missing the jump into apps, unfortunate timing as the enemies flashes ramp your teammate dodged and this allowed and enemy to push through banana and shoot you from behind. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, solid movement up the second middle and good job holding the apps peek, good angle clearing as you got to stairs but unfortunately you got peeked on a timing you didn't expect maybe taking your time to clear and hold angles after a peek would have resulted in you being more prepared for this engagement. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly second middle, nice angle clearing in apps, good job getting into pit unforuantley your teammate decided to go arches when lane was clear which got him killed by the enemy in library and this forced you to push out of a comfortable position to retrieve the bomb. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice thinking mollying behind the counter smoke this pushed one of the enemies up onto first oranges and allowed you to secure that kill then you managed to get a second on the enemy coffins, unfortunately getting traded by an enemy CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, panic spray when you spotted the enemy pushing middle from second middle this caused your initial spray to be off, fortunately when the enemy engaged you again you were ready and managed to track him well securing that kill, solid rotation towards banana and then good job holding the flank to kill the flanker. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, when you see they smoke deep middle and flash its a big indicator they will probably be pushing down, communicating this to your teammates and preparing for the engagement would be very useful, unfortunately only after you heard them shooting middle did you peek which led to you getting timinged on your middle engagement and getting flanked from apps. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I like the confident push-out apps when your teammate killed the middle and apps player, good positioning lane although this can be an extremely difficult after-plant position to play, solid initial kill on the enemy brackets but your first peek was slightly too wide allowing for the second enemy to instantly trade you. L</li>
                    <li>CT pistol armour, playing family is a solid position really good tapping and nice angle on the enemies pushing up from banana, clean double kill. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, nice agro peek banana after your teammates killed a few middle, and interesting aggression down banana even though you had the weaponry disadvantage but you managed to make it work well securing a second kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice try at doing the banana pop flash, the enemies were rushing as well and they had a better spawn than you meaning they could peek instantly. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice agro peek down banana and solid utility with the flash and smoke. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good aggression unfortunately your flank didn’t work out well as you were making noise which allowed the enemy to turn around and get the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting aggression unfortunately it didn’t work out well in your favour although I liked the attempt. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice quick trade kill on the enemy pushing top banana, solid counter smoke towards top banana, and good patience on the kill. W</li>

                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be careful when panic spraying as slowing down your shots just a little bit can be the difference between landing the kill and a complete whiff</li>
                    <li>Make sure to change your positioning and movements to avoid becoming predicatable and being read by the enemy.</li>
                    <li>Always be ready for engagements, I want to you visualize all the possible positions an enemey could be in and peek those positions like you expect someone there.</li>
                    <li>Try to learn the earliest engagment timings across all active duty maps, as you were caught off guard a few times during this match.</li>
                    <li>Don't get caught up in your agro plays, if you get one or two kills if you think there might be more, there is no need to continue and be overconfident.</li>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Anubis <br>Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, solid positioning around pillar A site, and a very nice opening kill and solid followup damage, although you started panicking and this caused you to spam a bit too quick causing your bullets to be inaccurate and for you to not really line up your shots. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, solid positioning towards close B entrance by the smoke, although the flash through was a little overly aggressive fortunately there wasn’t an enemy there. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, solid positioning with the Famas close B entrance on the right, and nice idea to take an engagement with a smoke break, but unfortunately it seems like you were not ready for the actual engagement catching you slightly off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, accidental double smoke close B entrance, and the same position 3 rounds in a row although you were only spotted last round this is something to be cautious of, nice idea to reposition but it was executed badly as you were reloading as you were passing a potentially dangerous angle, good job picking up the better weaponry from your teammate, solid kill on the enemy rotating through middle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, When peeking water your crosshair placement wasn’t very focused if there had been an enemy holding it, it would have been a very dangerous fight, good job going for the flank after your teammates called an A and solid retake kill. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, unfortunate timing on the reposition as it completely gave away your position allowing the enemy coming from water to swing you, and it seemed like you were not completely ready for that engagement. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, I really liked the idea to go for the Agro B peek but then after hearing multiple you decided to change position and angle which was a good call although I would have preferred it if you would have tried to reposition more quietly instead of jumping as this still alerted the enemies to your position, good kill unfortunately you got flanked from water while focusing on B entrance. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job hearing them falling back off B and then going for the quick flank although very lucky timing on your side to stay alive after he full blinded you and you still managed to get the kill, good attempt at the retake although unfortunately it was a little slow this allowed the enemies to play time and you didn’t have a kit, good initial kill. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice try at getting into the close right angle B but unfortunately they spotted you which put you in a very awkward situation and then your peek into them was a little slow which allowed them to spot the edge of your character and prefire. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid B entrance smoke this round, but nearly got caught completely off-guard by the enemy already peeking you water, fortunately you could fall back, really unfortunate engagements after the enemies decided to squeeze you on B doing a mid split and some unlucky sprays. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, good attempt at the early engagement unfortunately it didn’t go your way although you did manage to do good damage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunate timing not understanding how quickly the enemies can peek you from B entrance and the late smoke from your teammate meant you were caught throwing LOS utility. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, small movement fail going T spawn for the rotate, but good job recognizing the mistake and following your teammates, taking a solo engagement against the enemy water who unfortunately managed to secure the kill against you. L</li>
                    <li>Upgraded pistol, nice attempt at catching the enemy on B off-guard by using his bad smoke but it seems he was ready for it as he was holding the exact position you peeked from. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement around the enemy smoke although caught a little off-guard when your teammate broke the smoke but you managed to spot an enemy and once it came back you prefired the same position and secured a very nice kill, really good afterplant positioning when waiting for the last to enemy to rotate in although you played it a little agro. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good job being weary of B as they have usually be smoking it, really nice quick entrance onto B although throwing some exposed utility nearly got you in trouble twice, good job managing to secure the triple to win the round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good early flash but, the spray whiff and commit it what got you killed when you tried to transfer between two enemies and you were suddenly exposed to 4. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good game knowledge to check for the flank and you even had a very nice peek but your spray let you down in this engagement as it seems it was slightly outside of your comfortable distance. L</li>
                    <li>P250, running around with your teammates and making a lot of noise right outside A indicating there are multiple of you allowed the enemies on the other side to counter utility quite effectively forcing you to go B, nice quick aggression allowed you to catch an enemy in connector off-guard, a little agro trying to kill the saving player who managed to kill you but it was only a p90. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job looking around the edge of the smoke for any enemies taking an engagement and you nearly caught one, with a good followup nade in case he decided to stay in the same position but then you went hyper-aggressive without support from your teammates in terms of utility so you basically just jumped through a smoke which an awper was holding and that was a free kill for him. L</li>
                    <li>P250, taking a slightly more silent approach towards A, unfortunately, the enemies were very aware and smoked early unfortunately due to your advanced position to A entrance they threw a nade which hit you for 50hp and you were quickly finished off by an smg. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at peeking middle which is an angle you haven’t really fought thus far, and good recognition of the danger and alerting your teammates of the potential danger as well, Good trade kill as you came into B from middle but unfortunately your teammates couldn’t alert you to the position of the last enemy and due to being so low from the previous engagement you were quickly finished off. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, I like the change of pace going for the agro peek middle and catching the awper off-guard but you went hyper-aggressive which allowed you to be caught off-guard by the second enemy. L</li>

                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>A bit tired. A bit tilted from the previous game and frustrated to be honest. and I think in-game I am too easily tilted.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I think of all the games I play on Anubis I have only gone B and maybe sometimes middle.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I would say it was rarely on the enemy as I don’t play Anubis enough to have a proper understanding of all the positions they are holding me from. </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I feel like flicking wasn’t that bad and I think everything went downhill after I got tilted mid-game. Not really happy with the spray patterns of the primary rifles.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Peeking-wise, I think that most of my peeks are decent.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I think I barely rotated this game either I died first or they hit b. To be honest I was lost most of the time and got confused. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I think I only used 3 pieces of utility this game and I don’t think I used a lot of utility. </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>No, I am unhappy with my communication and I felt that I didn’t convey enough information as I didn’t know the callouts. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>To know my limit on CT and know where the enemy can possibly peek me from. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>I wouldn’t have any problem with that. </li>

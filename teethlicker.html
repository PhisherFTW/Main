            <h1>General Goals & Focus Areas</h1>
            <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="red">Always try to only engage one enemy at a time and take fights on as tight an angle as you can, there were a few situations that game where you overexposed yourself to a few enemies at once.</li>
                <li class="red">Try to use your CT side advantages whenever possible (Positional advantage / Advantage of holding) With Positional advantage, you want to keep your position hidden as long as possible in order to try to catch the enemy off-guard also changing your position basically every round ensures that you are not caught off-guard often, and Advantage of holding is mainly beneficial when you are holding an angle in which you can react to secure the kill, this is most effective when enemies are coming out of a tight chokepoint and to properly take advantage of this, make sure you don’t give them the site for free.</li>
                <li class="red">Practise spraying with the primary rifles (AK/M4/Galiel/Famas) and Main SMG on each side (MP9/Mac-10) you will be using these 95% of the time so they should also be the majority of your weapon practise. This practise will be done with a Death Match technique call “Run / Stop / Flick / Shoot” which puts full focus on the fundamentals, as if you have some of the best fundamentals in the game you will be one of the best players in the game.</li>
                <li class="red">Prefiring unnecessarily this is a skill that you have obviously been practising for a while as its quite ingrained into the way you play but I feel like you use it too often, prefiring in my opinion should only be used in 2 situations (An enemy has been playing the same position multiple rounds in a row and you are pretty sure he is there / 2. You just engaged an enemy on an angle and you managed to duck away, but you want to reengage them and are pretty sure they are on the same angle, prefiring in this situation is okay.) Randomly prefiring at somewhat common angles will give away your position and if you miss your prefire it gives the enemy a huge advantage in that initial fight as you need to wait for your weapon to reset unless you can manage to continue the spray.</li>
                <li class="red">Use weapons within this optimal range, now this wasn’t prevalent during the match but I think its absolutely crucial to master this skill early on, this was like I said during the review playing weapons within the range at which they do best ie, SMGS/Shotguns/Upgraded pistols (Close range) / Rifles (Medium to long) / Awp/Scout (Long)</li>
                <li class="orange">Although it wasn’t very prevalent you threw a few pieces of LOS (Line Of Sight) utility which exposes you to the angle in which you are throwing utility at which is dangerous, although you didn’t really get punished for this, this is something to be weary of.</li>
                <li class="orange">If you hear enemies going for a reload/falling back these are usually go opportunities to activate, there was a situation when you were on a low buy and your teammate played an agro angle ramp and you heard the enemy reload this would have been the perfect opportunity to secure a free kill on an eco.</li>
                <li class="orange">Flicking off enemies you haven’t killed, now the “Run / Stop / Flick / Shoot” Death Match Technique will fix this issue as I noticed you were doing this consistently while playing deathmatch previously which obviously aids in your current habit.</li>
                <li class="orange">Patience, use your teammates more to your advantage there were a few situations where you pushed in completely alone or ahead of your teammates and although you were not really punished during this game, I can see it being a problem later on when you are facing higher levels, I think working with your team and timing your peeks better with your teammates could allow you to excel in site takes and executes.</li>
                <li class="orange">Over-Aggression, this can likely be related to your patience but there were a few situations where you wanted to continue to take more space than was necessary and this put you in a disadvantageous fight, which ended up getting you killed and putting your team at a disadvantage.</li>
                <li class="orange">Although you did a pretty good job of this only being caught off guard a few times, I would recommend focusing on always keeping engagements within the optimal range of your current weapon, ie smg/shotguns/pistols (close range) / Rifles (Medium) and Awp/Scout (Long range)</li>

                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>prefireing unnecessarily giving away your position making it easier for the enemy to know your position.</li>
                    <li>Spraying medium - Long range is challenging.</li>
                    <li>Flicking off of enemies you haven’t killed yet after failing to kill them with ~3/4 bullets is a bad habit that can show itself in-game.</li>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, moving about ramp before your teammates are ready to execute on Palace can be quite dangerous, good entry pathing onto site and nice pathing to take the engagement against the enemy bottom stairs although it was a bad fight as you were temporarily exposed to cat/connector, your positioning towards tetris was exposed and when the enemies pushed from stairs you were caught off-guard and out in the open. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, peeking out ramp solo, good peek under palace with proper preaiming to secure that kill, nice flick onto the enemy on site to secure a second, and slightly over agressive peek into the connector smoke but you managed to completely catch the one enemy off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, nice kill onto the catwalk player, good job upgrading your weapon to the M4. W</li>
                    <li>M4-A1s, Going towards ramp for the early pick gets you punished as the enemy is able to close the distance between you and the enemy, which gives his smg the advantage in this situation. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job reacting to your teammates coms about the enemy pushing A ramp, this caused you to turn back and help secure the kill, (Learn to use the communication wheel to more accurately communicate with teammates), flicking off an enemy that you missed your spray towards twice, but good job securing the kill on the awper. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good pathing onto site, unforuantly your teammates were not covering your plant which got you killed from an enemy triple. L</li>
                    <li>AK buy, (Decides not to buy utility except for molly?) Nice molly towards van unfortunately it seemed like it landed on belcony, which would have prevented your teammates from coming out apps effectively, there were 3 enemies holding apps which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice middle take and good kill on the enemy towards catwalk, there was a second but your positioning to peek him wasn’t the best, coming up connector you seemed a little lost, until you saw the enemy default but unforuantly you got killed while crossing to stairs from top con triangle, from an enemy CT. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice tight headshot onto the enemy window, usually when in a 1v2 situation they will either split up or sit on the same site, so always fake the first plant or if you have a smoke drop that and plant inside it, unforuantly the enemy peeked you while you were planting. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, good movement and pathing onto site, but your peek into connector was unnecessary and dangerous when you could have forced a closer range fight if they pushed out of connector, unforuantly this allowed them to secure the kill on you and have a chance at the retake. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice peek towards the enemy jungle with very good crosshair placement although the prefire was unessesary if you would have just peeked normally without the prefire you woudln’t of had to reset your aim before you could shoot and you would have secure the kill faster, dangerous second fight against the enemy catwalk this was unnesary. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, awesome shot against the enemy window, good kill on the enemy catwalk while being fully blind from your teammate and nice reaction to the third enemy on-site managing to secure that kill, the only mistake was smoking underhand catwalk which was an LOS smoke and planting for catwalk while having no-one hold catwalk and not knowing the position of the last enemy. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol molly,grenade, buying utility on pistol rounds will always be hard to properly use, unfortunately this round both of your grenades didn’t hit their mark and didn’t do any damage or have impact and this led to you having to take a fight and without body-armour you died with a few stomach shots. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, good job not staying in window with the smg and changing it to connector, good kill against the enemy top stairs and then a solid spray on the last enemy to secure a second. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, Good initial positioning on B this would have allowed you to get at least one free kill on the planter, but unfortunately due to your teammates shoddy calls you dropped off the boost and this forced you into an unfavourable fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, jumping van late is very dangerous as there could be an enemy already in apps and you are inaccurate after landing for a while, good attempt at the retake although you were being a bit aggressive with your clearing on-site unforuantly you thought he was still in the smoke but he managed to go firebox and catch you off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, your teammates terrible calls pulled you out of a decently good position and after rotating back into B you accidentally exposed yourself to 3 on site. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, generally on these save rounds you want to position yourself in a position that is a headshot angle and a superclose range angle, you managed to get into a decent engagement against the enemy close jungle but unforuantly you were not able to hit the headshot. L</li>
                    <li>P250 armour, teammate said he would solo B they executed, you managed to secure one, but green was hardcore baiting you which got you killed when you were double peeked. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid kill on the enemy holding jungle with the awp. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good kill on the first enemy running out connector, solid second flick to catch a second and good job switching weapons to a rifle to secure the last. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>No, my hands were sweaty.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I like playing default on A / Connector, I think the position is awesome, but I don’t think I have ever top fragged playing connector.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I am really comfortable with how I aim, either I die or they do.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I know my spray is really wonky with the AK47, I am trying to improve it during my aimbots sessions. Pretty confident</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>T side, I definitely it was a little more expected, I feel like I found myself panicking a little bit.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I feel pretty comfortable movement wise around the map, I feel like I could polish up my peeks more. Rotating I always feel like I have an issue of bouncing around the map too much. (potentially not using Minimap optimally)</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I tried using more utility, I just kind of have an issue with remembering lineups. I feel like I have a hard time figuring out when to use my utility and I struggle to use all of my utility before I die.(Learn to utility dump usefully.)</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br> N/A</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I should have faked the plant that one time on B.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>No</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Try to use your CT side advantages whenever possible (Positional advantage / Advantage of holding) With Positional advantage, you want to keep your position hidden as long as possible in order to try to catch the enemy off-guard also changing your position basically every round ensures that you are not caught off-guard often, and Advantage of holding is mainly beneficial when you are holding an angle in which you can react to secure the kill, this is most effective when enemies are coming out of a tight chokepoint and to properly take advantage of this, make sure you don’t give them the site for free.</li>

                    <li> Full buy, Nice initial position behind Bench and then when you thought it might be an A you rotated into market to allow you for the quicker rotate, nice quick rotate into the A site, and good job not going overly aggressive, unfortunately when you heard the one enemy triple you overexposed yourself to multiple site and CT angles which allowed the enemy to double peek you, good job getting one but you got instantly traded. L</li>
                    <li> Full save, good job playing a nice close angle ramp, although I would have liked to have seen you go for the kill when your teammate died and you heard the enemy reload, I understand you were weary of a second but after not hearing a second set of footsteps catching the enemy reloading would have been a good opportunity. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, very nice early molly apps, good positioning towards market to allow for the quick rotate towards A while still maintaining some control of B, good use of your positional advantage by rotating into jungle silently to catch the last enemy on stairs completely off-guard. W</li>
                    <li> AK buy, good early molly apps, nice sneaky early angle holding deep apps, although jump spotting has fallen out of fashion it is still the go-to for information, very nice job catching an enemy window/jungle with a crisp shot, and fantastic patience to wait for the enemy to drop onto site and catch him while he was reloading, you played that perfectly. W</li>
                    <li> AK buy, good angles into apps nearly catching the enemy fighting you early, but you did manage to catch them as they jumped up onto the shelves, unfortunately as you rotate into market the enemy jungle was peeking you from outside deathhole and managed to secure the kill on you catching you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, Good change of angles playing the van angle for the first time this match, and solid rotation after your teammates sighted the bomb but you were aware enough to understand that your teammates didn't have control and thus they could still rotate to B which caused you to stay in market, no action. W</li>
                    <li> Full buy, You ping apps as you were flashed early, good positioning towards the bench ready to catch any enemies that managed to get out onto Balcony but your teammates managed to secure most of them, good job getting the last enemy with a nice sneaky angle from van. W</li>
                    <li> Full buy, good job giving an awp drop showing your awareness of your economy as well as allowing your team to more easily take mid control, playing your default left site angle into apps, although you rotated into a bad position towards death square which could have left you exposed, unfortunate timing on your rotate up catwalk with the enemy walking out apps and planting the bomb. W</li>
                    <li> Full buy, good early round control of B, but unfortunately your team lost middle early due to bad communication, leaving you in a 2v4, you manage to secure one kill on an enemy rotating from window to jungle but you get instantly traded. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, The enemies took A early which caused you to rotate into Jungle, good job securing the kill on the enemy peeking at you from Sandwich, good nade into Firebox which did a lot of damage to the last enemy and you managed to secure the win with the bomb defuse. W</li>
                    <li> T Pistol armour, early-mid to B, this strat can be very difficult if not executed correctly as it exposes you to the highest number of long-range angles which suit the CT usps better, but with the window and con smoke, this allowed your team to go up catwalk mostly unscathed, good kill on the enemy peeking window with the usp. W</li>
                    <li> Mac-10 buy, nice smoke out A, solid pathing, no action. W</li>
                    <li> Mac-10 buy, good patience waiting top middle for the utility to land Connector and window, unfortunately, you do get dinked from connector as you are going up cat and then when engaging an enemy on B site you take the fight at a bit of a distance with low ammo which allows the enemy to secure the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, nice flash into middle, although from the trajectory of the Molly landing top middle, I would have liked to have seen you identify the enemy lowers, unfortunately as you move into middle you take a lot of damage from a grenade getting you down to 14 and then a solo fight against the mp9 con unfortunately lead to you dying. L</li>
                    <li> Galiel buy, good grenade towards Van, and a very nice shot onto the enemy peeking from the site, good job upgrading from the Galiel to the m4, with an unfortunate peek into window when an enemy lowers was holding it. L</li>
                    <li> Full save, small bit of blocking as you were going into TV room, taking a far-range angle deep into apps with the Glock will get you killed if anyone peeks that, good attempt at going onto B with your team, unfortunately, there was an enemy with am XM under the window which is the perfect position for that weapon. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, you tried to peek the bottom stairs angle which is usually quite a dangerous angle, unfortunately, the enemy stairs were able to see you and managed to secure the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li> Full save, good patience waiting for your teammate's utility to land window and connector, unfortunately, while pushing up catwalk the enemies burst your con smoke and shot you in the back, the enemies have been doing this consistently throughout the game and getting free kills. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, good movement out ramp although I would have liked you to have been a little closer to the first player out in order to secure that trade kill, good job securing a kill on the enemy on site but unfortunately there was a molly dropped ramp which managed to do a few ticks of damage to you and kill you. W</li>
                    <li> Full buy, Your team was unfortunately very broken up this round taking individual fights early, you managed to secure a nice early kill on an enemy attempting to get deep apps information, I would have liked to see you clear short while going out apps as that is the next most likely position, good job getting the bomb down and staying alive. W</li>
                    <li> Full buy, your teammates early peeked middle which initially put you down into a 3v4 situation, your teammates then managed to get some entries onto A, where you were able to get the bomb down good job, where your teamamtes called CT and stairs, unfortunately you didn't trust your teammates calls and your positioning under balcony left you completely open to them, if you had hidden firebox this round would have likely gone in your favor as it would have taken the enemy too long to find you and your teammate. L</li>
                    <li> Galiel buy, going for the early B peek, unfortunately, the enemy throws good utility landing a grenade right on you taking you down to 56, good entry onto the B site securing but unfortunately getting traded by an enemy towards the bench side. W</li>
                    <li> OT 1 T side Full buy, good awareness of the potential for the connector smoke, good attempt at getting the trade on the enemy window, unfortunately, it didn't go your way, while going up A ramp, you accidentally overexposed yourself to an enemy peeking you top stairs. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, slightly dangerous LOS flash out ramp, small burst almost gets you killed as an enemy peeked you ramp, if you had sprayed you would have likely secured the kill, unlucky timing on the push out onto tetris as an enemy peeks triple, being on low HP from the earlier fight make this engagement very difficult. L</li>
                    <li> Full buy, nice kill on the enemy window, there was an enemy short who pushed into the window unfortunately catching you off-guard with his peek, I would recommend always holding the window unless its smoked and still sometimes holding it even if it is smoked unless you are trying to make a play. W</li>
                    <li> CT Full buy, good molly apps, really nice double dink on the enemy through Apps window, I like how you played around site while waiting for your teammates to rotate in, unfortunately, they were extremely slow this allowed the enemies to spread out all over site and eventually shoot you through a smoke. W</li>
                    <li> Full buy, nice early round positioning in Market as you felt an A execute impending, this allowed you to get a quick rotate in as they were executing, no action. W</li>
                    <li> AK buy, good positioning towards market expecting another A taken, although your preemprive rotates allow you to get into a good position CT allowing you to catch the last enemy. W</li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>No I was good.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I think I do my job on B site pretty well, I think I could have played it better.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>50/50, I feel like my aim was super shaky that game and during sprays I felt like I kept flicking to the left and down to the right.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Sprays felt very very off, especially with the m4a1s and super all over the place.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I think CT was a lot better than T, I feel like I kept losing gun fights and I kept strafing into prefires and dying.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I feel like I could have rotated earlier a couple times during that match.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I feel like my utility usage that game was awful, I bought too much and didn’t use enough, I felt like I was very hesitant with it as I didn’t want to expose myself with it.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>N/A</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Not playing so scared, I think sometimes I refrain back into a position where I play more support.</li>

            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spray control, I believe spraying will always be the superior shooting method in the vast majority of situations, as more of the common engagements you will take fall in medium - close range, which spraying excels, I have linked the spray master map which you said you already have incase its a different version, and you mentioned how you used to get high scores and how they have decreased, I want to include this into you training routine along with the Run/Stop/Flick/Spray FFA Deathmatch method.</li>
                    <li>When entrying onto site as a T, you want to spread out a little to make it as difficult as possible for the defending CT to get a multi kill, small changes in pathing can increase the likelihood of you being able to react to an enemy in an odd position greatly.</li>
                    <li>Whenever there is action before proceeding to a course of action make sure those actions will not negatively affect you, during this game there were a few times when you hyperfocused on an event and this led to you overlooking important angles or putting yourself at a disadvantage, try to evaluate your current situation before reacting to events.</li>
                    <li>Always try to force engagements within your weapons optimal range, there were a few times where you peeked with an SMG at a range outside of throwing distance and this is never advisable as it puts you in a huge disadvantage in this engagement, always position yourself in angles with suit you weapon.</li>
                    <li>Positioning is one of the most important things in this game, if you have bad positioning you will constantly be putting yourself in disadvantageous fights, if you have other methods of clearing angles like mollies I would highly recommend using it even if there is no-one there its not a waste, as the alternative is manually clearing the angle in which case you might lose the 1v1 in a 50:50 fight and if you do clear an angle that exposes you and there is no-one there, now you are exposed to other angles which is very dangerous.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I would like to see you use the: Run/Stop/Flick/Spray FFA DM method, taking counter-strike down to its most basic form, I strongly believe that spraying is the superior shooting method in the vast majority of situations as it allows you to get the most bullets towards the enemy per second out of the 3 main shooting methods tapping/bursting/spraying, and once learnt it makes the overall game easier, so with the above method no fancy movement of jiggling just taking simple fights and spraying until either they die or you do, as the higher level you get, you usually won’t get an opportunity to have your spray reset and will usually die if you whiff.</li>
                    <li>Spraying medium to long range has improved significantly but I still think if it improved you will notice a nice improvement in your overall gameplay: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3100869952</li>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, Solid B rush to start the round, gives good close to medium range angles, although unfortunately, no-one cleared the Corner on B site which got a quad kill against you and your team as you ran up scaffolding. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, really good damage onto the M4 sitting top ramp unfortunately he was outside of the optimal range for pistols so even though you hit him 3 times with a headshot you were not able to secure the kill, fortunately, your teammates quick secured that trade. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Going for a mid take, although you hyper-focus on the enemy close overlooking an enemy sandbags and CT and elevator, you then ignore the enemy sandbags and focus on the enemy elevator who managed to unfortunately land a dink on you bringing you down to low hp. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, good attempt at going for the trade, on the enemy skinny but you are at a huge disadvantage at this range as the bullet damage dropoff is huge and you hit him 35 in 3, which means it would have taken at least 8 bullets at that range to secure the kill, I would have recommended trying to close the distance earlier as you and your teammates were all peeking him one by one allowing him to get an easy triple. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, unfortunately walking out first with the bomb into B stairs, and because you didn’t have control earlier in the round the enemies were able to position themselves anywhere, so when you did clear the close left corner that was a big risk and unfortunately there was an XM there. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement up ramp, I would have liked to have seen you clear it more strictly as you moved up quite slowly and then clear out sandbags with a molly, but unfortunately before you had time to do that an enemy got a double kill on your teammates towards sandbags this prompted you to move forward which exposed you to multiple angles while you hyper-focused on the trade kill, which ended up getting you killed by an enemy Sandbags. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, nice attempt at getting an entry top ramp, although I wish you were playing closer to solid cover so you can get a shot off and duck behind cover. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job dropping a headshot smoke and nice job getting the bomb down, unfortunately, your teammate got timinged and let an enemy up ramp which caught you completely off-guard because he was meant to be holding it, solid round from you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Be careful when you need to crouch into an angle as typically the person holding the angle will have the advantage, really nice quick trade kill on the enemy back corner on B site, then a fantastic double entry while checking the edge of the smoke, nice bomb plant, although while holding flank I would have liked to have seen you use the double boxes on-site as cover and when engaging an enemy directly using spraying at that range might have resulted in a different outcome, unfortunately, you only hit him once and he managed to get the kill on you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly towards sandbags as you came up ramp, really nice headshot on the enemy headshot although your open position was dangerous and going against a better awper you would have died, fortunately he missed and you did a good job getting the bomb down to apply additional pressure. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement up B ramp although going for the initial tap nearly cost you your life you quickly followed it up with a solid spray to secure the kill, I could see you were very worried about that B back corner, but you overexposed yourself to manually clear it, I would have preferred to see you drop a simple molly there to clear it, as unfortunately after you cleared it manually you died while exposed to multiple angles. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good movement up Ramp and solid molly sandbags but unfortunately the enemy stayed in your fire longer than you expected and caught you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>CT pistol armour, solid angle from the elevator although I would recommend extending the distance whenever possible as unfortunately because of the common angle the enemy was able to prefire you after learning your position. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice smoke down Ramp, although with the MP9 I would have recommended playing closer skinny but you managed to make the most out of it by using some solid reactionary utility in the form of a molly towards skinny which forced an enemy to run through taking significant damage, unfortunately also getting you low, good job getting the trade on the enemy who pushed through B getting the flank and you caught him while he was reloading which was perfect, as you rotated into A you didn’t clear the left side peek which is exactly where he was, good bait though as your teammate was able to find the position of the enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job assisting with middle early nearly catching an enemy with a spray through the smoke, but then rotating onto A site was a bad choice as it suddenly exposed you to several dangerous angles and while jumping onto the A site boxes an enemy peeked you ramp catching you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, good patience towards elevator, and nice peek into Middle to secure the kill on the lurking AK, although after your team had secured the round with the defuse it was dangerous to run into Middle with your knife out as that is where you saw the last enemy. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good job picking up the ak from last round, perfect positioning towards the box by skinny allowing you to instantly catch an enemy pushing onto site, and then with your teammates quickly rotating in they were able to clean up the rest. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, positioning towards the elevator early can be quite challenging but you played it quite well being able to secure one kill on an enemy skinny, personally, I prefer to play headshot as I believe it gives more advantageous fights and opportunities. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice ramp smoke and a good attempt at early aggression as this would have been the first time you took this fight this half, but you peeked close to the angle you always want to peek from as far away from the angle as possible, this gave the first enemy the advantage, nice kill on the enemy swinging elevator. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice close angle next to box allowing you to completely catch an enemy pushing, while playing within the chaos you nearly secure another but they end up disappearing onto site, you are patient and check the smoke ramp, this lets you get another kill, although while muting your extremely toxic teammates you get killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again peeking very close to the skinny angle would put you in a huge disadvantage fortunately no one challenges you on this angle, you peek into middle although not expecting the enemy to be on the right side of the smoke as a grenade blow it open, this catches you off-guard and allows the enemy to secure the kill. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, good use of sound although your smoke towards skinny left you with only the ramp angle and at that range while playing close box you would have been put at a huge disadvantage, no action. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, you are playing the same angle previously although you do manage to get a kill against an AK, well done usually this is a very bad fight, but unfortunately, you do get instantly traded. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice smoke ramp, nice job keeping your positional advantage until you saw bomb in middle, although your positioning in Middle was crazy changing angles constantly and accidentally exposing yourself to multiple angles, and then when you knew the position of one, you chose an angle that still exposed you to multiple which got you killed by the unknown player. L</li>
                    <li>OT R1 CT, Full buy, really nice double kill on the enemies peeking wide middle, nice use of ping to identify the bomb, although I want you to focus on identifying the gaps in your defence after securing the bomb instead of looking where your teammates already are. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, although this position elevator can be good, you generally don’t want to play it with a teammate towards skinny as it greatly simplifies the crosshair placement of the enemies pushing up Ramp onto site, good job getting one although it was a bit messy and then you nearly got caught throwing LOS utility, and unfortunately due to your earlier fight you were low hp by the time you decided to peek onto site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, missed your ramp smoke, and the wild full swing rotate towards B. I like the urgency to assist your teammates but you have to do it safely as during this round you full swung an enemy lurking Middle who caught you completely off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>OT T side, Full buy, I like to see that you unmuted your teammates and gave them another chance, nice movement up ramp and solid positioning although the enemy still technically had the advantage as you were closer to the angle but you managed to secure the instant headshot. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job checking the edge of the ramp smoke, and I like the fact that you mollied sandbags but I don’t want this to be an LOS molly, use the cover provided, nice trade kill on the enemy peeking above headshot, and very nice last kill winning the game. W</li>
                </ol>

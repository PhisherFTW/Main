                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/wH2Ce-plT0o">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t do repeat plays on CT side as it gives away your “positional advantage” and make it obvious for the enemies to counter you.</li>
                    <li>Don’t walk into fights whenever possible don’t walk in “danger” angles, these are angles where in your mind there is more than a 20% chance of an enemy being there.</li>
                    <li>Reloading in high conflict areas isn’t a good idea as it has a high chance of you getting killed while reloading, only try to reload when you are 100% safe from the enemy and ideally out of the distance where the enemy can hear you reload.</li>
                    <li>Whenever changing positions always keep your crosshair towards the position that poses the most threat to you even if this makes movement slightly more difficult as you could rather be looking at the danger than have to do a 180 turn to try get the kill.</li>
                    <li>For eco buys, don’t buy armour and default pistol (usp/glock) always upgrade your pistol which is your firepower and don’t buy head armour so the normal eco buy is: Deagle(or Tec9) + body armour.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>13.Full buy, nice push into tunnels for a lot of good info, and solid push into middle allowing you to secure a good double kill, little bit of overaggression hunting down the awper alone in a 2v1 situation but fortunately, your teammate was able to clutch. W</p>
                    <p>14.Full buy, another push into tunnels allowing you to quickly flank T spawn, solid first kill trade on the enemy who killed your teammate, unfortunately, you walked into the next angle an enemy was holding which was towards T spawn side and this allow him to have a huge advantage in this engagement as he got to see you first. L</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice attempt peeking towards top middle this is generally quite a good fight at the usp is extremely good at long-range engagements but unfortunately and enemy managed to land a revolver shot on you which was quite lucky on their part. L</li>
                    <li>MP9, nice tunnels aggression this seems to be a reoccurring play for you from the previous game as well, good job coming up the catwalk and solid bursting on the enemy goose, you reloaded out in the open while still having enough ammo which could have easily gotten you punished, unfortunate spray on the second enemy was a slight whiff. L</li>
                    <li>Famas, a solid push into tunnels with a flash to get a kill on the enemy top tunnels and then falling back after the initial aggression, nearly caught reloading but fortunately, you were able to get the kill, but then going for the kill again while still having 14 bullets got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, push again into lowers and there was no one there this allowed you to flank T spawn and get a kill on an enemy who was AFK or had just thrown utility. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Again pushing lowers, good job trying to keep the headshot angle advantage, and falling back but when you left lowers you did not check middle and this could have easily gotten you killed if there was an enemy on short or top middle, solid rotation around back into tunnels from B and nice position lowers to hold for the aggression unfortunately I think you fell asleep on the angle as it took you a while in order to start shooting. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, sometimes shooting and moving which isn’t good and your spray control doesn’t look comfortable, because of how bad the famas is I always recommend closing the distance between you and the enemy with a famas imagine it as an upgraded smg instead of rifle. L</li>
                    <li>usp armour kit?, this buy is very weird and I do not recommend using this combo and combination with significantly more firepower would be Deagle + Bodarmour, although I would have recommended asking “Homo gang” for a drop instead as he had 6k in the bank, unfortunately, you decided to do the same play you have done the previous 5 rounds and the enemy expected you and was ready for you. L</li>
                    <li>Nova buy, lowers push again, your positioning was a good idea closing the distance with the shotgun but because you had done it so often before the enemies were expecting it and countered with a shotgun of their own, unfortunately, you missed your 2 shots and the enemy landed theirs. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round, Solid attempt at a B push, unfortunately, you died to the enemy peeking window I would have recommended trying to close the distance a little bit as the glock is stronger close range. L</li>
                    <li>galiel buy, good communication while rotating towards B and taking it, unforuantely you moved while shooting which threw off the accuracy of your bullets also whiffing your spray on the enemy shooting at your buddy caused you to die. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice bursting onto the enemy catwalk to secure the kill, unfortunately, you do not feel comfortable spraying and this forced you to stop shooting halfway through your burst to wait for the accuracy to reset and this ended up getting you killed by the enemies pushing behind you catwalk, W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid attempt at taking mid-control and good job spotting the enemy running up middle early but unfortunately because of your spray control you were not able to secure this kill on the enemy pushing you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement up the catwalk, unfortunately, you got a fright from an enemy lowers causing you to jump and then turn around, fortunately, the enemy also paniced and ending up missing all his shots allowing you to get the kill on him, still you are moving and shooting a lot and this is causing you to be inaccurate. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement up catwalk and a really good double entry onto A site with some clean bursting. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job peeking midd early and getting a solid entry pick, unfortunately, you peeked short alone and without utility and this allow the enemy short to see you quite easily and land a shot on you which you were already low from your previous fight. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>I was pretty comfortable.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I think sometimes I forget and don’t have good crosshair placement.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying and Never.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I think I need to improve on all of that.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I felt like in general and overall I think I rotated pretty well.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I don’t think I negatively impacted my teammates, I could probably use more utility and overall I think my utility was not great and not terrible.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I tried to give as many comms as I could in-game and although they are not always perfect I think they are decent.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Expanding early round CT playbook</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> Didn't really ahve any in-depth conversation, but I got carried pretty good and yes I would play with them again.</li>

            <div class="acc-content">

                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/dAdSDqMkJtQ">Video</a>
                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol FFA, solid crosshair placement but sometimes shooting slightly too quickly causing your deagle/usp to be inaccurate.</li>
                    <li>Rifle FFA, quick switching after every kill got you punished a few times, bursting is okay but sometimes you burst before your crosshair is on the enemy's head.</li>
                    <li>A lot of fights are taken when moving forward this causes you to be a little slow as you have to counter-strafe using the s key and I don’t think you are doing that as it looks like you are sliding to a stop, ideally 95% of your fights</li>
                    <li>Slight movement issues when moving around the map.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy body armour by default on both sides on Pistol round.</li>
                    <li>Only ever expose yourself to 1 angle at a time.</li>
                    <li>Whenever running long on Dust2 show your back towards long as you are running up to dodge any enemy flashes and throw a molly into the door-way to stop them from coming out.</li>
                    <li>When shooting at people boosting always shoot the one on the bottom at the one on top will drop causing them to be inaccurate longer allowing you to secure the kill on them.</li>
                    <li>Try to throw at little LOS (Line Of Sight) utility as possible as it only exposes you to danger, while you throw utility you could have probably thrown from a safer position.</li>
                    <li>Always try to position yourself close to cover so if you are caught slightly off-guard or flashed you have somewhere to fall back to I noticed a couple times on B you were exposed while throwing utility without any easily accessible cover.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>13.Full buy, nice push into tunnels for a lot of good info, and solid push into middle allowing you to secure a good double kill, little bit of overaggression hunting down the awper alone in a 2v1 situation but fortunately, your teammate was able to clutch. W</p>
                    <p>14.Full buy, another push into tunnels allowing you to quickly flank T spawn, solid first kill trade on the enemy who killed your teammate, unfortunately, you walked into the next angle an enemy was holding which was towards T spawn side and this allow him to have a huge advantage in this engagement as he got to see you first. L</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol Flash, a weird buy I usually recommend buying body armour as aim punch is terribly during fights also the fact that it only take 3 body shots to kill you without armour as opposed to 8+ with body armour, I recommend body armour especially at your current skill level as using utility to the same benefit level as having body armour will be incredibly difficult. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, nice positioning with the scout long, no enemies, nice attempt at backing up your teammates on B but by going window you are exposing yourself to 2 different angles whenever possible we want to avoid this and only leave you open to the angle you are ready for. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, unfortunately the T’s will always beat you out long if you try to get to pit, and your flash wasn’t enough to deter them, if you want to get into pit on a consistent basis without repercussions you need to understand the spawn you need and the molly that needs to be dropped, unfortunately they caught you while you were crossing to pit blind. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at doing damage on the enemy catwalk nearly securing a kill a small spray whiff caused you to miss, good peek onto site from short allowing you to get one kill but you couldn’t react to the awp goose. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, sitting in the middle of the open while dropping a flash into tunnels isn’t a good idea as you are throwing LOS (Line of sight) utility, which you only ever want to drop when absolutely necessary, solid rotate to where the bomb was dropped and nice peek long securing the final kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid positioning B with the headshot angle, again standing out in the open with the smoke to drop it tunnels which is slightly dangerous as an enemy could have easily had a timing, nice rotate towards A, bad timing to call for a boost as they could have peeked the long cross and this was dangerous, nice realization that the enemy was too far from the bomb to kill your defuser and calling for your buddy to defuse, solid kill on the last enemy middle. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, again standing out in the open, unforuantely you got punished this time, as they counter flashed you which caught you off-guard and then you tried peeking platform which unfortunately didn’t go your way. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice peek long and a solid kill, standing completely out in the open left of the blue bags isn’t a good idea as if you miss 1 shot you are basically dead. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round armour, nice B take and good job going back tunnels to backup your buddy fighting an enemy lowers but he ended up leaving you there after the enemies started trying to retake site you forgot about the enemy lowers which unforuantely ended up peeking you late as him buddies were on site. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, Solid pathing up short and good kills on the enemies site and car, unfortunately you were swiftly traded after killing the enemy car. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice attempt at peeking out middle unfortunately the enemy pushing lowers caught you off-guard and won this 50/50 fight. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, this is not ideal as the AK is significantly better than the galiel and you should try ot get it as often as you can, I like your confidence peeking the awper window this is usually not ideal as they have the advantage of holding, again peeking angles while moving forward instead of sideways, solid kill on the enemy peeking you from door unfortunately you got overrun by enemies peeking window and door. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice pathing out long but looking around while in pit almost got you in trouble, good idea to pickup teammates awp but you were trying to run over it instead of using E to pick it up.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>In general maybe like a 6, also its pretty late.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I just went wherever I felt I was needed.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Probably similar to what I said last time, at some points it felt good and at some other points bad, overall decent.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Sometimes on the enemy and my spray felt sometimes it was good.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Something I am still struggling with is taking peeks and how to spray and how to stop properly.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I don’t know exactly what the right stuff is all the time so I would say it was quite average.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>So I think in that game I felt like I didn’t manage money right and this caused me to not buy enough utility.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I’d say the callouts in general as a team were not the best and definitely could have been better.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I think, I try to get a gameplan at the beginning of each and every round.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>The teammates I queued with I liked.</li>

                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick switching after kills isn’t a good idea as it keeps getting you in trouble while you wait for your gun to shoot again.</li>
                    <li>Currently sometimes while spraying aiming at the body and waiting for the bullets to rise from the spray pattern.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid taking unnecessary damage whenever possible if from enemy util or fall damage as this small amount of damage could lead to you losing a fight you would have otherwise won.</li>
                    <li>Avoid throwing LOS (Line Of Sight) utility whenever possible as it is extremely dangerous for little reward and usually there is a better way of throwing that particular piece of utility, shooting the enemy will nearly always do more damage than any grenade or molly you are about to throw.</li>
                    <li>Focus on syncing up your movement and aiming as it seems sometimes you are ready to start shooting but your movement isn’t quite there or you move into a good angle without being ready to shoot yet.</li>
                    <li>If you get a decoy or buy one, I recommend using it as a fake flash instead of just dropping it in spawn.</li>
                    <li>Always buy head armour on T side, as a rule because not having head armour allows your full loadout to get killed by one pistol shot.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol armour, B rush, good job not pushing through the late molly, a tiny bit of unnecessary damage, on the molly taking 1 tick of damage, bad positioning towards back platform as you are artificially creating distance between you and the enemy and during pistol round you want to close the distance with the Glock, although you managed to catch the enemy window off guard securing a kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement catwalk, unfortunately, the enemy was running around the corner which caught you off-guard and he was super close range which allowed him to catch you off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice instant trade on the enemy catwalk, nice flash into the A site, although when going for the peek your preaim and movement were off and this allowed the exposed enemy to get back onto site, and on your repeek, you threw LOS utility which was dangerous and could have gotten you killed it also didn’t land on site which is where you wanted it to land, then you peeked out catwalk while having low bullets from your previous engagement which led to you running out of bullets during the fight. L</li>
                    <li>CZ, nice dink on the enemy catwalk and good positioning short to catch anyone rotating from A site, good patience, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice middle smoke, although you were challenging an awper at long range which gave him the advantage in this fight leading to him winning. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid long take and good reaction to get the trade on the enemy long and nice patience to wait for the regression and get the kill on him, although your positioning and movement were off during this round, nice attempt at peeking into long house but it wasn’t executed properly which meant when you got into the fight your crosshair placement was off. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid B take although no utility, unfortunate timing on the enemy peeking window getting the kill on you with a scout. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, a wasted decoy in spawn, I recommend using it as a fake flash or dropping it on the bomb after its planted for a chance of doing a little bit of damage, solid kill on the enemy pushing uppers from lower stairs. W</li>
                    <li>Pistol armour, solid B positioning and once your teammate pushed tunnels it become obvious that there was no one there causing you to rotate to CT to be accessible anywhere. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no head armour this is questionable as I think this is what got you punished on the previous round, having no head armour basically turns any pistol or smg into a AK, so you have to be very weary, good job securing a kill on the enemy middle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, still no head armour,nice job dropping a molly long, although I do recommend hiding behind the wall before moving into the pit, fortunately, no one was challenging this round, solid damage onto the enemy around middle but unfortunately dropping a nade on your teammates head wasn’t great. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job dropping the molly long but this time you nearly got caught while crossing, this is why I recommend dropping the molly and hiding behind the long corner wall and then repeeking while rotating from pit to A site you didn’t keep your crosshair glued to the most dangerous angle which was long and this got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice peek towards long, although unfortunately, I think you fell asleep a little bit, interesting reposition to behind the car, although when on low hp I don’t recommend this position and a slightly better position would have been site or CT as the enemies were pushing up short and long. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice quick lowers push, and flank through long spawn, solid kill on an enemy top middle, I will show you the god off-angle when holding long house from either side, unfortunately, they clear the close left as they are coming out long. L</li>
                    <li>CZ, when playing with the CZ its a wild weapon and I recommend closing the distance as much as possible and shooting in short 2-bullet bursts when at medium and tapping at long range. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, solid rotation to A, no action. W</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Pretty comfortable although desk is a bit high.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>Felt pretty good, and playing long has felt better, although my spray and aim feels off.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I think my crosshair placement is half the time good and not good the other half.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Sometimes and recently with my spray I don’t feel confident.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I am not thinking about any of the peeks I am taking or about my peeks or when I peek just instinctually, It felt decent</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I think my rotations are pretty good although my positioning isn’t great after repositioning.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I definitely naded my teammate, but other than that I am not sure.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>Its probably something I can work on it was kind of mediocre. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I put myself in a position where I could get twice as many kills, but trying to get better aim and better spray control.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>I had some good teammates, </li>

                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>First bullet accuracy isn’t super strong, some more focused practice on that would be great, also sometimes shooting before your crosshair is on the enemy.</li>
                    <li>Getting comfortable with the spraying for the head technique and idea</li>
                    <li>Over-reliance on crouching while spraying making you an easy target.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>CT pistol always take far-range engagements when possible and try to have cover close by as the CT pistols don’t have a lot of ammo.</li>
                    <li>Whenever buying SMGs always buy at least body armour if not full armour as taking aim punch while having an SMG is not ideal and getting killed in 3 bullets while spending.</li>
                    <li>Focus on lining up your crosshair on the enemy before shooting especially if you are behind them at this will give you more of an opportunity to multi-kill.</li>
                    <li>Use walking to your advantage more as currently you are running in a lot of places and this information is given to the enemies allowing them to be more ready for your engagement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>Map: Vertigo</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, bad position top boxes middle fortunately you didn’t get punished but I recommend standing at an angle that is long range and that allows you to easily fall back, good job falling back and securing a kill. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9, no armour, this is a bad idea especially when you have $2400 in the bank as the aim punch you would be taking is a lot, unfortunately, this was the case in the fight against the enemy midde as he shot you your crosshair jumped up a lot and it takes less bullets to kill you without armour. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at using a 1-way smoke in middle nearly securing 2 kills, unfortunately, the one enemy realized your positioning and managed to kill you. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, interesting position close unfortunately you made your position known early and this allowed the enemies to counter you and for you to lose your positional advantage. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice headshot positioning on B looking into ramp but unfortunately, the enemies running up ramp checked that angle and won the duel. L</li>
                    <li>dualies, basically a full save, good job getting a quick flank but unfortunately because you were running the whole way the enemies could hear you flanking and were ready. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice early ramp aggression after realizing there was no one there, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, ramp smoke fail, nice movement and peeking up skinny, but pulling out your flash skinny was dangerous and it gave away your intentions, nice rotation behind the enemy although you started spraying before your crosshair was on the enemy this led to you whiffing your spray and the enemy peeking back into you and then you decided to reload while still vulnerable to a repeek and you had 8 bullets left in the magazine. L</li>
                    <li>T-side pistol armour, nice kill on the enemy ontop of site, unfortunate timing on the second peek as you got double-peeked while short and ran out of ammo. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid kill on the enemies pushing middle and nice job falling back and holding behind this allowed you to secure a kil on the flank, good job attempting to get into an off angle but because you ran there in middle the enemy CT hear you and knew where you were. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, peeking skinny while walking forward nearly got you killed but good crosshair placement to secure the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement and positioning up B stairs, solid trade kill on the enemy behind aircon. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, unfortunate whiff spray on the enemy peeking from A site while you were short. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, peeking B solo very wide and quite unfocused allowed you to be thrown off when taking this first fight on stairs. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning looking into middle but unfortunately when you got flashed you didn’t take cover and this allowed the enemy to land an easy short on you from middle. L</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Comfortable</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I honestly don’t know the map that well so I don’t have any preferred positions.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Almost never.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Very Bad.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Man everything in that game just felt terrible.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I died a lot so I don’t think I really made it to content a lot of bombs</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I am sure probably not and I think the only utility I can remember was middle smoke and the attempt at a ramp smoke</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I feel like I had decent callouts for my teammates.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I think having a better gameplan going into the game.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Pretty quiet game.</li>

                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/tv6Svs-4MLQ">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When playing with the glock, your intentions should be to get as close as you possibly can to the enemy using aggressive movement this reduces the distance giving your glock the advantage.</li>
                    <li>When placing your crosshair try to be extremely vigilant when it comes to its height as I noticed a couple times during this game your crosshair was slightly low.</li>
                    <li>If buying utility and commonly throwing very early utility, you can buy another piece that was previously left out.</li>
                    <li>Peeking an angle with utility when it has not been previously cleared.</li>
                    <li>Throwing LOS(Line of sight) utility where the enemies are easily able to peek you on a timing.</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice attempt at tapping the enemy back platform, whenever you are engaging in a duel you want to try to get as close as possible, you can use jumping and air strafing to accomplish this because the distance from tunnels to back platform gives the enemy there the advantage, good reaction to the second enemy peeking and getting the kill onto them but unfortunately you also got flanked from lowers and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, solid movement up long, and nice peek on the enemy by elevator but unfortunately he dropped a really solid flash getting you completely and this allowed you to get killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice Xbox smoke to allow your team to go up catwalk, good job holding the flank and getting the kill on the enemy flanking, small spray whiff as the second enemy catwalk peeks you wide throwing your crosshair placement off. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice xbox smoke again, crosshair placement when peeking lowers was low as you already had teammates out middle, solid peeking up catwalk and good job securin the kill on the enemy ramp, Nice reposition in catwalk by stairs, unfortunately, the enemy ended up smoking the bomb and you had forgotten its precise whereabouts this meant that you ended up missing an entire clip, nice attempt though in the 1v3. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid kill on the enemy flanking top middle and then after getting shot catwalk you immediately got the second kill. W</li>
                    <li>Fullbuy, nice flash for long, nice jump across the CT cross to avoid getting headshot, solid trade kill on the enemy peeking through the CT smoke and good use of prefiring to kill the enemy peeking catwalk. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement up catwalk, nice kill on the enemy peeking from Ramp with perfect preaim. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again early xbox smoke working perfectly, if you are using an early piece of utility every round don’t be afraid of immediately buying another piece of utility like a flash, good job smoking the long cross to allow your teammate to cross and nice attempt at peeking into CT, unfortunately, it was a 2v2 situation and your got flanked from Long getting killed car while looking CT. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice kill on the enemy good, very solid spray on the enemy peeking from CT, peeking out wide from short with a grenade in your hand was a bad idea you should never peek an unknown angle with utility out, and again this falls under LOS utility which is not recommended. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at mollying car but you rushed the lineup a little but and this led to you missing it, also while falling off of holding flank to push long with your team you looked away from the most dangerous angle and this got you punished because that is the timing that the enemy did push. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice attempt at awping middle, unfortunate double miss on the enemy dropping from catwalk and crossing CT, although solid reposition from suicide to top middle unfortuante timing on the enemy rushing up middle catching you completely off-guard and killing you with a scout noscope. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement out into middle but lucky timing on the peek this allowed you to get past the awper bottom middle holding the cross, solid peek attempt into catwalk allowing you to do 50 damage but unfortunately it wasn’t enough and the enemy ended up killing you. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, solid positioning after getting flashed from lowers but your peek was erratic and you came out spraying the p250 when you should have been heavily focused on getting the headshot, unfortunately, you didn’t get the kill but your teammate quickly traded. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, missed xbox smoke, this made it so you got tagged twice while going up catwalk and leaving you on 19 hp, while rotating into B, nice flash into cubby as you and going onto the B site and really good usage of the spot I recommend by the B door, solid double kill. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, nice attempt at catching the enemies crossing you can quite confidently hold the door if you think you can hit the timing, solid movement up long and decent positioning car, unfortunate miss on the enemy pushing through the smoke but then you pulled out your knife, I know you wanted to quick switch but just staying on the awp would have allowed you to get the second shot off quicker, unfortunately, you quickly got flanked from Long. L</li>
                    <li>CT pistol armour, good job keeping the distance between you and the glocks crossing to site, this allowed you to shoot all of your bullets but unfortunately, none of them connected with a headshot and this left you without bullets getting you killed, you should have gone short as your teammate had died there and you could have gotten his pistol. L</li>
                    <li>Dealge buy, good job holding long until the moment you were safe from the long angle, although your rotation into car was questionable as car doesn’t provide very good cover it also exposes you to the entirety of short as the enemies are coming up and this led to you being multi peeked. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, solid lowers push with flash, although you called before you actually cleared it this led to you being caught off-guard when there were enemies holding tunnels from outside causing your shots and peeks to be a little slow. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice peeking towards long and good usage of the pit headshot angle on the long house angle, unfortunately, as you were rotating up catwalk you were left in a 1v5 situation which I would recommend immediately saving in, good job killing one middle, unfortunately, you got prefired in lowers by an enemy hunting you. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice molly long and then a solid followup peek to secure the kill on the awper long, and nice reposition into the pit headshot angle to regain your positional advantage after your previous position was compromised by the dead enemy, really nice spray control securing the second kill but again looking away from the most dangerous angle to you after picking up the upgraded weaponry, always assume that there is an enemy at the closest point you can be shot at. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice kill on the enemy top middle, but you were playing with that scout top middle, the scout has an extremely high movement speed over most other weapons and this allows it to move extremely quickly people will use this when fighting middle to try wallbang or as they did here get you to stand extremely still while they try to bait you into shooting and then counter-strafing and killing you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly long and solid positioning pit, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement shot and good positioning, nearly caught off-guard by an enemy jumping but you managed to adjust and secure the kill on him, in this situation I would have recommended falling back immediately but because of your positioning you could and this caused you to try pull out utility which got you immediately punished. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid awp peek long and good job holding the angle, unfortuante timing on you leaving the angle and then getting immediately pushed, this is called getting timinged in CS:GO and it happens all the time. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good usage of the corner smoke, but leaving long isn’t a good idea as now it was completely open as you were at car, you then realized this wasn’t right and started rotating back to long but then your teammate on site got immediately killed by a person on this prompted you to stay and fight the enemies on short but from car which exposes you to long and a lot of players on short which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy nice nade short and solid peek onto the enemy gandalf but your jump onto site when facing the enemy short wasn’t a good idea as you were vulnerable the while time while yo uwere jumping and half a second after landing and this exposed 60% of your body going for this peek. L</li>
                    <li>MP7 buy, peeking long angle with a piece of utility out got you heavily damaged I don’t recommend peeking previously uncleared angles with utility. </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>I think I am a little more nervous.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I mean somewhat if I was getting good long spawns I would got there and if I got a B spawn I would go there. </li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Somtimes on the enemy</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Somewhat, sometimes it felt good, on T side spraying felt a lot better but on CT side it didn’t seem as good.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>On CT side I was kind of holding angle more and on T side peeks felt decent.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I guess on T side it felt pretty good, but on CT side it just felt off and I am sure we all messed up quite a bit. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>So I think a big thing of mine is getting into the habit of having a plan for the utility, and as for impacting a teammate I don’t think I naded a teammate.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>Yea I don’t think my teammates were giving good callouts but I definitely thing I could have been giving better callouts.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Focus on your CT side.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Yes</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When deciding to save there are a few factors you need to take note of: Who has the numbers advantage? How long has the bomb been planted for? What is my teams economy like? during this game you attempted a few retakes that should have been saves.</li>
                    <li>When reloading make sure you are hidden behind good cover and not moving into a position that could get you punished.</li>
                    <li>Changing positions after engagements to keep your positioning unknown and makeing it more difficult for the enemy to preaim you.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>Map: Short Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, really good usage of the headshot angle from CT holding the cross allowing you to secure a very nice triple kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid rotation from long to B site, although once you reached the window it was a 1v4 situation, I would have recommended immediately saving as having a rifle in the following round would have been more beneficial that dying in the current one. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, really really nice quick long flang managing to catch 3 enemies completely off-guard and securing a really nice triple allowing your team to secure this round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good knowledge to recognize the enemy out middle and get a solid peek on the enemy and good reposition on catwalk holding for the flank from B in middle, securing a double kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good long molly and hide protocols, good job rotating towards CT after your middle player died early, although after being left in a 2v4 situation, it would have been a better idea to call for a save instead of going for it. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice lowers push, securing a lot of information and calling it out, good job killing the one enemy in long house but running towards it while reloading wasn’t a good idea, nice job going into the door off-angle I recommended while watching long house, great round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly long although the nade short caused a it of damage to your teammate, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again going for the fast lowers play, unfortunately, you pushed deep early and this allowed them to secure the kill on you as you were not expecting them to be there. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round, armour, nice job killing the enemy lowers, and good positioning close door in that corner. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really nice movement up long and good kill on the enemy on A site, solid followup on the enemy gandalf and then a third by gandalf, nearly clutching in the 1v1 unfortunately the enemy with the scout jumped noscope you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice double spray down on short and a good dink on the enemy elevator. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good damage on the enemy flanking, unfortunately, it wasn’t enough. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice movement and angle clearing, really nice shot on A site and then a second very good shot on the enemy CT although you movement around short wasn’t the best and sometimes accidentally exposed you to anyone CT, good job getting into an off-angle on short completely catching the first enemy off-guard but because you stood in the exact same position, which allowed the enemy following him to know your exact position. </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Everything seemed good.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>Yea I think I have been going long a lot, and if I feel like they are going B I go there too.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Usually on the enemy.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>It felt pretty good, my AK spray I definitely feel like I am getting better.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I am not really aware of the types of peeks I am doing its just instinctive. </li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>So like a couple times I went long and there was already a teammate there, and overall rotations were pretty good.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I know one nade I threw up short hit my teammates, I think maybe I have more of a plan on CT side, I think I could use more utility on T side.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>So I was trying to call out as best as I could, although I am sure it wasn’t perfect but overall I think it was pretty good.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I think my CT side felt comfortable and having a better B execute would be great.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>They were all good players but didn’t communicate so no. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Low Crosshair placement work on trying to keep it constantly at headheight.</li>
                    <li>Try not to move into angles that are vulnerable to positions you are not directly covering.</li>
                    <li>LOS utility peeking angles with grenades pulled out without previously clearing them with a weapon.</li>
                    <li>Attempting retakes when you should save such as in 2v4 sitautions with little time.</li>
                    <li>Not looking at your minimap enough, as you are sometimes covering or mollying positions your teammates already have deep control over.</li>
                    <li>Don't hold an awp angle unzoomed as the act of zooming in usually significantly increases your Time to kill.</li>
                    <li>Bad movement while blind causing you to run infront of the enemies.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>Map: Inferno</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <p>24.Awp buy, confident peek into banana but due to the enemies dropping a deep nade this made it very difficult for you to spot the enemy top banana and by the time you were able to see him he had already spotted and killed you. L</p>
                <p>25.Mac10 buy, low crosshair placement looking directly at the floor, unfortunate timing on you going to top banana as the enemy awper had pushed through the middle and flanked banana getting a free kill on you. L</p>
                <p>26.Mac10 buy, unfortunate movement and positioning walking forward into the banana angle and then taking a fight against the enemy top banana which is heavily favoured in the enemies direction causing you to lose this engagement. L</p>
                <p>27.Scout buy, nice kill on the first enemy banana although your positioning for cover wasn’t ideal as you were still exposed to the enemy which was getting you shot. L</p>
                <br>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>wasn’t able to see. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, solid positioning to B but when you noticed how quickly the A players died you could have rotated slightly quicker and when rotating through CT you were not paying attention to the CT push which got you killed while you were looking and jungle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning on van to secure a quick kill into apps on an enemy with a grenade out. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning under belcony but your use of utility was incredibly dangerous, nice job getting the kill with the grenade but this was a LOS piece of utility and if an enemy did peek you, it would have been very bad, when trying to drop more utility you do get peeked and this nearly gets you killed fortunately you are able to hide again and a solid peek onto the enemy tetris. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good rotation to stop the enemy from flanking through deathhole into B but low crosshair placement aiming for his stomach which required you to hit him multiple times before he died. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, LOS utility again and if you got peeked into CT while you were throwing this it would have been very bad, interesting smoke to help assist with you maintaining control over the bomb. L</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good attempt at rotating early to help your teammates on A, but unfortunately by the time you got to CT you should have called for a save as it was 2v4 and the bomb had less than 18 seconds, which isn’t ideal. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, some bad movement going through deathhole, bad peek from jungle into palace, unfortunately, getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, bad molly towards palace as you already had a teammate deep in palace, and then holding palace slightly more focus on recognising your teammate's positions to prevent you from wasting utility and effort holding an angle that is already covered. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, weird peeking down from top connector this is dangerous as you are exposing yourself without cover and if you miss one shot its over. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice damage onto the enemy pushing jungle quick but when rotating our of window you looking into the wall instead of in the direction of danger, good job saving the awp for the next round. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid peek towards middle, as the jungle player your primary focus you be on dealing with anyone palace as this is one of the most dangerous angle to your position, you accidentally exposed yourself to palace multiple times fortunately your teammate was able to kill the enemy palace before he could kill you, zooming and unzooming at weird times, solid quickscope. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice double kill while retaking the B site, unfortunately, you got flanked. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, bad movement while blind meant you accidentally ran out from bottom stairs exposing yourself to everyone ramp and getting yourself killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice early rotation to A before they even saw anyone, but your peek and reaction wasn’t ideal which allowed you to get double-peeked while in CT. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, died to USP in window, bad spray. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10, nice CT smoke, good entry onto A, but when crossing from jungle to A site you exposed yourself to the jungle and didn’t even look at the enemy jungle and this could have gotten you in a lot of trouble, and immediately switching but not checking how many bullets you have left in the mag and this got you killed as you could only hit 4 body shots which wasn’t enough to kill the enemy CT. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice attempt at killing the enemy window, I like your confidence. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting CT smoke, unfortunate timing on the peek ramp as your teammate full blinded you as you peeked which got you instantly killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid peek towards middle, nice movement to chair and catching the enemy catwalk off-guard and securing that kill, crouch walking into angles isn’t ideal and shouldn’t be done, solid kill on the enemy bottom stairs, and nice idea to peek the corner but it wasn’t executed the best. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, peek middle window I really like the confidence, although unfortunately, it doesn’t go your way the second time. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9 flashes,  good patience outside Apps, but unfortunately the enemy pushed agro and this got your two teammates killed, your positioning and peeks were not ideal for tec9 which is what got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice CT smoke although you could have just thrown the lamp flash, solid kill on the enemy top stairs, unfortunately as you peeked out ramp you didn’t clear the close left angle and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9 flashes, nice double flash over B apps, and good job picking up an XM shotgun but your positioning wasn’t ideal to use it so your first engagement was disadvantageous ontop of you not having any body armour. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, really nice peek into middle securing the early pick, blinded your teammate who was clearing the connector, when worried about another angle completely forgetting that you are vulnerable to multiple angles like exposing yourself middle so you could clear TV room, unfortunately getting peeked by the enemy window late. W</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I am trying to learn new maps so I have been playing a bunch of positions I don’t feel comfortable in. </li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Sometimes on the enemy and less favourable. </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Felt out of it.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I peeked however it felt natural to me, and I have realized using utility is so important and I think they could definitely be improved.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I feel like my rotations are pretty decent and as far as bumping into stuff it felt a little clunky.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I tried to buy util and I just try to throw it wherever it felt useful, and I believe I did the best with what I know.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I don’t think the team, in general, was really giving callouts, I don’t believe my callouts were that great.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Learning the best way to do entries on T side.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Yea, I would play with them again</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Low Crosshair placement</li>
                    <li>Try not to peek angles with utility pulled out, the long molly on Dust2 is a slight exception to this rule as if you get the right spawn you can beat the enemy there.</li>
                    <li>When intending to take an engagement try to always position yourself with a little bit of cover to allow you to have something to play around.</li>
                    <li>Don't jump into angles as you are completely vulnerable while in the air and for about 0.25 seconds after landing as you are completely inaccurate.</li>
                    <li>Try to keep your weapon out if there is any chance of your getting into an engagement as dying with utility or knife out is an extremely unfortuante way to die.</li>

                <p>Map: Short Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, Solid positioning on B, and nice usage of site box for cover, crosshair placement is a bit low hitting one enemy 5 times, and solid headshot kill, overall pretty good damage. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, Nice lowers aggression, although unfortunately, the delay for you to drop the flash into uppers was enough for the enemy to come sprinting towards you and catch you slightly off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, Nice rotation toward A after they took long, really good usage of the headshot angle CT to watch cross and get a kill, nice job picking up a weapon short and choosing the right weapon for the long-range fight, but after realizing the disadvantageous fights and how long the bomb was down for you made the right call to save. L</li>
                    <li>Mag7 buy, nice job using the weapon you save, accidentally knifed your teammate on the cross, again pulling out your utility to flash into uppers got you put into a disadvantageous fight against the enemy quick in uppers. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice job trying to molly long but you didn't have the right position to do it and thus the enemies were able to do a lot of damage on your peek, interesting choice to drop the smoke long and then wide peek this was dangerous as all it took was 1 bullet to kill you from your earlier engagement long. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice execution of the long molly with proper protocols and hiding after you dropped it, after realizing the took A site control from short you tried to push up long which was quite dangerous as you had no cover and they ended up peeking you wide and catching you slightly off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, don't attempt the late long molly, especially without clearing the angle first you usually never want your peek into an angle to be you holding utility, unfavourable fight on the enemy long as this engagement was significantly outside of the optimal range of the mp9 and against and AK. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, better upper flash this round in one smooth sweeping motion, really good information to your teammates as you go for the flank through T spawn, although I would have recommended instead of going up short going through long, no action. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, short rush, nice tapping on the enemy car to secure that kill, unfortunate engagement on the enemy on site. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice early agro peek long and good damage securing the kill on the enemy long with the flash assist of a teammate, peek into CT could have been slightly more methodical, bad peek against the enemy long jumping into the angle from site, which made this fight incredibly hard to win. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flash long, nice kill on the enemy pushing long agro, nice spray to secure the first enemy outside B but your commitment to the spray made the third fight very difficult. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice Xbox smoke for your teammate's middle, pulling out your knife while moving through middle is a dangerous decision and this unfortunately led to you getting picked while moving up short quickly. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice xbox smoke, solid movement and peeking up short although crosshair placement while clearing angles could have been cleaner, nice molly onto A site, really nice flick to get the kill on the enemy flanking you short, and solid spray on the second enemy lowers to secure that kill, good job planting the bomb, nice usage of the angle by the door and solid third kill on the last enemy pushing out the window. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice Xbox smoke again, solid movement up short nice nade to try to assist your teammate lowers, good off-angle position short to catch the enemy flanking completely off-guard and then going for the quick flank on the enemies outside B, really solid overall round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice xbox smoke, small molly fail trying to molly site, good damage on the enemy site which helped your teammate finish him off, nice reaction and kill towards the enemy CT. W</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>very solid first 6 bullet spray</li>
                    <li>Very good job making sure your crosshair is "locked" on the enemies head and not shooting too quickly </li>
                    <li>Movement around the map and into peeks could be improved, I would recommend making your movement more fluid by playign easy KZ maps</li>
                    <li>General crosshair placement could be improved as it sometimes strays quite low and quite a bit of time looking at unimportant angles while moving crosshair</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LOS Utility</li>
                    <li>accidentally over exposing yourself to the enemies</li>
                    <li>During full buys make sure you always buy full nade sets. "Rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it."</li>
                    <li>I don't recommend crouching behind bad cover (Wall bangable) as it makes it extremely easy for enemies who are good to track you behind it.</li>
                    <li>I recommend changing positions after securing a kill as this mitigates how many enemies know your current position and helps prevent prefires and good preaims.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>Map: Inferno</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice peek down banana early and agro, this fight can be quite favourable as the distance is significant if you can peek early enough, taking quite a big hit of nade damage but this is expected when playing common positions, good job playing pit and looking out of the possible flank, no action. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, solid investment but I would have recommended full buying and using that extra 850 for some flashes and smoke, as it would have helped you fend off the B push, instead of just going aggressive, but that still worked you definitely caught them off-guard and managed to secure 1 kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good upgrade on the full buy, although still leaving a little money in the bank with $300 which could have gone to a smoke or flash, good positioning CT asking for the boost, although when teammates call a lot alt middle you rotate fully, fortunately they still decided to commit to A after killing your teammate flanking usually this would prompt a rotate, your timing on your peek was bad as you accidentally allowed the enemy to get into pit good job still getting the kill, but a small whiff on the first kill left you with only 4 bullets left in your next fight, unfortunately leading to you running out of ammo mid fight getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>p250, Nice position boost CT this can be an incredibly effective pistol angle, and really good patience to stay for so long, nice timing to push banana and good flank on the enemy middle catching the kill on the guy not expecting you to push the banana smoke, this left you in a 1v1 situation, really really nice usage of walking to make your position unknown to the enemy as you entry onto the site, he didn’t know your position. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, nice nade into banana and again boosted CT, although with your teammates dying early on A this might prompt them into going A again, really nice patience to stay boost, this will definitely catch them off-guard if they push B as they killed your teammate top banana, and fortunately, they do decide to come towards B, your positioning was perfect allowing you to catch the first enemy for free and then dropping caught the awper off-guard causing him to miss and allowing you to get the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job dropping an awp to your teammate allowing him to go for agro peeks down middle which help you guys win the round, and really nice patience not getting greedy and starting the hunt the enemies, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at using utility on the enemies top banana, although it was a bit crazy, I will show you some lineups I recommend, good job not playing the CT angle after you had success previously and instead trying coffins which was good, nice spam into the smoke to secure a kill on the enemy top banana. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice job backing up your teammate pushing banana by peeking down, although a little indecisive with your positioning you finally settled on coffins, in this situation where it is a 2v4, you have enough money to attempt it although time was definitely not on your side as you were still deep on B by the time the bomb was planted, unfortunately as you were rotating through middle an enemy Mexico peeked up after you ran past him and killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, small molly mistake against the enemy top banana, nice position coffins although a weird way to play just ducking and peeking back up, a little bit of a wasted flash top banana, and bad timing on the rotate towards  A this led to you being out in the open when the enemies executed onto B, fortunately, you were able to get one, but because of the flashed you accidentally pushed yourself into coffins while exposing yourself to the enemies. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid nade down banana, a little bit of dangerous LOS utility peeking top banana from coffins, I would recommend throwing the same utility but from behind the coffins, really nice job dropping utility to your solo B player to help him hold and defend, nice peek on the enemy arches, good patience arches and the enemy accidentally exposed himself while planting default, reloading as you went onto site wasn’t a great idea but fortunately, the enemy was a lot further away, you managed to get into a solid position on A site and this allowed you to kill the enemy awper peeking. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again slightly dangerous LOS utility and a bit of a waste of a flash, good adjustment jumping top coffins but you overstayed your welcome quickly getting traded. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid nade and molly combo banana, good job leaving your one teammate banana and rotating and when died you went back, switching to the awp in a 1v2 situation isn’t common as if they double peek you, you are dead due to the time it takes to relaod and shoot again, good job switching back to the ak, unfortunately, your peek pit was super focused as you came around the corner allowing the enemy to land the shot with the autocannon. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, confident peek down banana, I like it although unfortunately, you overstayed your welcome again as there were enemies with weapons better suited to the long-range fight like the autocannon and awp, although you did manage to hit him twice for 23 damage. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice nade banana but your repeek with the molly was unwise as you repeeked a previously uncleared angle with utility pulled out, really nice initial kill on the enemy peeking top banana, and a solid damage on the second but your spray was a bit wonky, left in a 1v1 situation, good job realizing which site it was and again excellent usage of walking in this situation to allow you to get the position of the enemy and peek effectively locking down this round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good utility towards banana, and good rotation towards A after your teammates called it would be an A. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, good job with your patience banana as to not get double-naded, your peeking on B was extremely passive good job spotting the 1-way but due to the distance and the nature of it being a 1-way, you weren’t able to shoot back through it very effectively, also due to your passive natures this exposed you to multiple angles where you got punished from CT.</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, Solid second-round buy, although being weary of the close-range fight is something you need to take into account, good job backing up your teammate peeking top banana and securing one kill, your general peeking and aiming with the galiel this round had extremely low crosshair placement around stomach level. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, good job playing with your teammates towards A, although your eagerness to get the bomb down was slightly dangerous as your teammates were still clearing the site, I always recommend waiting for the site to be cleared before planting the bomb as planting the bomb basically makes to completely vulnerable for 5 seconds, got a bit caught up in the moment and died to the bomb, a little bit of a waste of economy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid peeking towards top banana holding for the aggression, really nice kill when the aggression did eventually come, nice flash peek into CT dangerous LOS utility CT and coffins with the molly and smoke, unfortunately, didn’t clear the angles properly close oranges which got you punished and killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice peek towards top banana after heavy utility to aid in defending against a push, little bit of LOS utility coffins gets you in a bit of trouble as you take some shotgun damage from CT, unfortunately on your peek the enemy decided to swing with the XM and land some very solid shots on you. L</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Very Bad.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Man everything in that game just felt terrible.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I died a lot so I don’t think I really made it to content a lot of bombs</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I am sure probably not and I think the only utility I can remember was middle smoke and the attempt at a ramp smoke</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I feel like I had decent callouts for my teammates.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I think having a better gameplan going into the game.</li>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Inferno</p>
                <p>Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, pushing apps although moving and peeking belcony alone when your two teammates were still boiler was dangerous, good job staying alive till your teammates were coming onto site but unfortunately, you were not able to trade effectively leading to the enemy being able to kill both your teammate and you. L</li>
                    <li>full save, nice job playing close to the smoke but you accidentally peeked into an angle where you could get shot at from someone middle, good attempt at playing the close range angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunate damage taken from a nade down banana because you lingered in the danger zone doing 25 damage, after your teammate got killed by the enemies moving banana your peek was slightly slow and this caused the enemy to see you while you were moving and this allowed him to start shooting before you did and this combined with the fact that you took damage earlier allowed him to secure the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, good job peeking into brackets with your teammate, and really nice plant veno, interesting positioning on site when ideally you would be Pit for this plant, but unfortunately your teammates left you alone in a 1v2 situation, ideally you would go agro against one of these opponents trying to get a 1v1 and then leaving you in a 1v1 instead of letting the opponent dictate the pace and choose when to double peek you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly top banana to prevent aggression unfortunately your team decided to try to go agro and this got him stuck between your molly and an enemies molly which caused you to accidentally kill him and lose $300, solid take onto the B site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good clearing of top banana but you did it solo, I would have recommended using slightly more utility as you cleared it, unfortunately an enemy peeked you close which caught you slightly off-gaurd although your crosshair placement wan’t bad it was low on the enemy causing you to go for bodyshots and because he landed the first bullets he had the advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly top banana, good flash peek into top banana although after the enemy dropped that lurk smoke top banana instead of trying to look over it I always recommend looking along the edge fortunately you managed to hit a nice flick and get the kill on the enemy playing around the smoke, unfortunate missed CT smoke causing you to take a disadvantageous fight against the enemy posted up on you CT. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, your team secured a bunch of nice opening kills, I would have recommended just grouping up together and hitting one site together instead of splitting up as this is how huge advantages lose rounds, fortunately that didn’t happen. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid banana molly, good job holding banan till your teammates were in advanced positions on lane, nice aggression on arches although it could have been slightly quicker, nice job catching the one arches but you should have been prepared for the second and the first one you killed had an SMG and the gun you saw earlier was an M4 which means there is probably another there. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice CT smoke and solid rotation to A but your teammates didn’t really follow you lead, leading you to trying to take A solo and rotating to arches through lane which it was odd that you had so much space and it turns out that one enemy was hiding which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good communication as you go onto B, and solid CT smoke, unfortunately as you were planting the bomb the enemy pushed through the smoke because it was temporarily a 1v1 as you were planting the bomb. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, almost throwing LOS utility good job deciding against it after some bullets fly past you, solid mmolly CT, good kill banana and nice reaction kill on the enemy towards CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid attempt at taking banana control unfortunately the enemies threw a weird top banana smoke and this caused you to hold the edge of it from wood and then you got killed over the top of it by a boost on wall. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, a little bit of unfocused peeking lead to you missing two shots on banana and top middle, good job legging the enemy towards middle which your teammate helped finish off, really nice double entry onto the B site with a good reaction kill for both, nice positioning dark and good job keeping your positional advantage to catch the enemy completely off-guard with a solid triple kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, late banana take with their deep utility although you didn’t think they were past it unforuatnely led to you pushing into an angle where you didn’t know where the enemy was and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>CT pistol armour, solid damage on the first enemy middle but your crosshair placement was quite low leading to you hitting 3-4 bodyshots which your teammate was able to finish off the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Half buy, nothing too much happened this round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, weird smoke towards top banana, nice patience on B and solid rotation towards A, unfortunate angle towards the A site from library getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>MP9, without armour this is a really weird buy I would have recommended a pistol with armour instead because if the enemy gets 1 bullet on you before you hit them you will die in 3 shots from almost any weapon including a glock, unfortunately this happens when you peek arches and due to not having body armour every time you got shot you crosshair jumped due to aimpunch. L</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, small flash failed on the first oranges pop flashes and then the wide swing peeking top banana wasn’t ideal as the enemy knew your position due to the sound and your footsteps, and unfortunately this fight wasn’t within the optimal range of the smg giving them the advantage in this fight. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice aggression into apps and good job catching the first enemy middle completely off-guard but you got slightly greedy and went back again and this allowed the second enemy to know your exact position and be ready for you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, flash assist with your teammate peeking top banana, good peek onto the enemy planting the bomb but unfortunately an enemy was already family or dark and this allowed them to catch you completely off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice aggression but unfortunately, the molly spread to the top of wall killing you. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, perfect positioning in apps in a super close range angle, unfortunateley your teammates left you in a 1v3 situation but you did manage to pickup the weapon of your teammate, unfortunately, the first engagement you get into top banana you were not fully focused on. L</li>
                </ol>

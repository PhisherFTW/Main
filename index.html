                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/wH2Ce-plT0o">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t do repeat plays on CT side as it gives away your “positional advantage” and make it obvious for the enemies to counter you.</li>
                    <li>Don’t walk into fights whenever possible don’t walk in “danger” angles, these are angles where in your mind there is more than a 20% chance of an enemy being there.</li>
                    <li>Reloading in high conflict areas isn’t a good idea as it has a high chance of you getting killed while reloading, only try to reload when you are 100% safe from the enemy and ideally out of the distance where the enemy can hear you reload.</li>
                    <li>Whenever changing positions always keep your crosshair towards the position that poses the most threat to you even if this makes movement slightly more difficult as you could rather be looking at the danger than have to do a 180 turn to try get the kill.</li>
                    <li>For eco buys, don’t buy armour and default pistol (usp/glock) always upgrade your pistol which is your firepower and don’t buy head armour so the normal eco buy is: Deagle(or Tec9) + body armour.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>13.Full buy, nice push into tunnels for a lot of good info, and solid push into middle allowing you to secure a good double kill, little bit of overaggression hunting down the awper alone in a 2v1 situation but fortunately, your teammate was able to clutch. W</p>
                    <p>14.Full buy, another push into tunnels allowing you to quickly flank T spawn, solid first kill trade on the enemy who killed your teammate, unfortunately, you walked into the next angle an enemy was holding which was towards T spawn side and this allow him to have a huge advantage in this engagement as he got to see you first. L</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice attempt peeking towards top middle this is generally quite a good fight at the usp is extremely good at long-range engagements but unfortunately and enemy managed to land a revolver shot on you which was quite lucky on their part. L</li>
                    <li>MP9, nice tunnels aggression this seems to be a reoccurring play for you from the previous game as well, good job coming up the catwalk and solid bursting on the enemy goose, you reloaded out in the open while still having enough ammo which could have easily gotten you punished, unfortunate spray on the second enemy was a slight whiff. L</li>
                    <li>Famas, a solid push into tunnels with a flash to get a kill on the enemy top tunnels and then falling back after the initial aggression, nearly caught reloading but fortunately, you were able to get the kill, but then going for the kill again while still having 14 bullets got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, push again into lowers and there was no one there this allowed you to flank T spawn and get a kill on an enemy who was AFK or had just thrown utility. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Again pushing lowers, good job trying to keep the headshot angle advantage, and falling back but when you left lowers you did not check middle and this could have easily gotten you killed if there was an enemy on short or top middle, solid rotation around back into tunnels from B and nice position lowers to hold for the aggression unfortunately I think you fell asleep on the angle as it took you a while in order to start shooting. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, sometimes shooting and moving which isn’t good and your spray control doesn’t look comfortable, because of how bad the famas is I always recommend closing the distance between you and the enemy with a famas imagine it as an upgraded smg instead of rifle. L</li>
                    <li>usp armour kit?, this buy is very weird and I do not recommend using this combo and combination with significantly more firepower would be Deagle + Bodarmour, although I would have recommended asking “Homo gang” for a drop instead as he had 6k in the bank, unfortunately, you decided to do the same play you have done the previous 5 rounds and the enemy expected you and was ready for you. L</li>
                    <li>Nova buy, lowers push again, your positioning was a good idea closing the distance with the shotgun but because you had done it so often before the enemies were expecting it and countered with a shotgun of their own, unfortunately, you missed your 2 shots and the enemy landed theirs. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round, Solid attempt at a B push, unfortunately, you died to the enemy peeking window I would have recommended trying to close the distance a little bit as the glock is stronger close range. L</li>
                    <li>galiel buy, good communication while rotating towards B and taking it, unforuantely you moved while shooting which threw off the accuracy of your bullets also whiffing your spray on the enemy shooting at your buddy caused you to die. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice bursting onto the enemy catwalk to secure the kill, unfortunately, you do not feel comfortable spraying and this forced you to stop shooting halfway through your burst to wait for the accuracy to reset and this ended up getting you killed by the enemies pushing behind you catwalk, W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid attempt at taking mid-control and good job spotting the enemy running up middle early but unfortunately because of your spray control you were not able to secure this kill on the enemy pushing you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement up the catwalk, unfortunately, you got a fright from an enemy lowers causing you to jump and then turn around, fortunately, the enemy also paniced and ending up missing all his shots allowing you to get the kill on him, still you are moving and shooting a lot and this is causing you to be inaccurate. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement up catwalk and a really good double entry onto A site with some clean bursting. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job peeking midd early and getting a solid entry pick, unfortunately, you peeked short alone and without utility and this allow the enemy short to see you quite easily and land a shot on you which you were already low from your previous fight. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>I was pretty comfortable.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I think sometimes I forget and don’t have good crosshair placement.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying and Never.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I think I need to improve on all of that.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I felt like in general and overall I think I rotated pretty well.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I don’t think I negatively impacted my teammates, I could probably use more utility and overall I think my utility was not great and not terrible.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I tried to give as many comms as I could in-game and although they are not always perfect I think they are decent.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Expanding early round CT playbook</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> Didn't really ahve any in-depth conversation, but I got carried pretty good and yes I would play with them again.</li>

            <div class="acc-content">

                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/dAdSDqMkJtQ">Video</a>
                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol FFA, solid crosshair placement but sometimes shooting slightly too quickly causing your deagle/usp to be inaccurate.</li>
                    <li>Rifle FFA, quick switching after every kill got you punished a few times, bursting is okay but sometimes you burst before your crosshair is on the enemy's head.</li>
                    <li>A lot of fights are taken when moving forward this causes you to be a little slow as you have to counter-strafe using the s key and I don’t think you are doing that as it looks like you are sliding to a stop, ideally 95% of your fights</li>
                    <li>Slight movement issues when moving around the map.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy body armour by default on both sides on Pistol round.</li>
                    <li>Only ever expose yourself to 1 angle at a time.</li>
                    <li>Whenever running long on Dust2 show your back towards long as you are running up to dodge any enemy flashes and throw a molly into the door-way to stop them from coming out.</li>
                    <li>When shooting at people boosting always shoot the one on the bottom at the one on top will drop causing them to be inaccurate longer allowing you to secure the kill on them.</li>
                    <li>Try to throw at little LOS (Line Of Sight) utility as possible as it only exposes you to danger, while you throw utility you could have probably thrown from a safer position.</li>
                    <li>Always try to position yourself close to cover so if you are caught slightly off-guard or flashed you have somewhere to fall back to I noticed a couple times on B you were exposed while throwing utility without any easily accessible cover.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>13.Full buy, nice push into tunnels for a lot of good info, and solid push into middle allowing you to secure a good double kill, little bit of overaggression hunting down the awper alone in a 2v1 situation but fortunately, your teammate was able to clutch. W</p>
                    <p>14.Full buy, another push into tunnels allowing you to quickly flank T spawn, solid first kill trade on the enemy who killed your teammate, unfortunately, you walked into the next angle an enemy was holding which was towards T spawn side and this allow him to have a huge advantage in this engagement as he got to see you first. L</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol Flash, a weird buy I usually recommend buying body armour as aim punch is terribly during fights also the fact that it only take 3 body shots to kill you without armour as opposed to 8+ with body armour, I recommend body armour especially at your current skill level as using utility to the same benefit level as having body armour will be incredibly difficult. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, nice positioning with the scout long, no enemies, nice attempt at backing up your teammates on B but by going window you are exposing yourself to 2 different angles whenever possible we want to avoid this and only leave you open to the angle you are ready for. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, unfortunately the T’s will always beat you out long if you try to get to pit, and your flash wasn’t enough to deter them, if you want to get into pit on a consistent basis without repercussions you need to understand the spawn you need and the molly that needs to be dropped, unfortunately they caught you while you were crossing to pit blind. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at doing damage on the enemy catwalk nearly securing a kill a small spray whiff caused you to miss, good peek onto site from short allowing you to get one kill but you couldn’t react to the awp goose. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, sitting in the middle of the open while dropping a flash into tunnels isn’t a good idea as you are throwing LOS (Line of sight) utility, which you only ever want to drop when absolutely necessary, solid rotate to where the bomb was dropped and nice peek long securing the final kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid positioning B with the headshot angle, again standing out in the open with the smoke to drop it tunnels which is slightly dangerous as an enemy could have easily had a timing, nice rotate towards A, bad timing to call for a boost as they could have peeked the long cross and this was dangerous, nice realization that the enemy was too far from the bomb to kill your defuser and calling for your buddy to defuse, solid kill on the last enemy middle. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, again standing out in the open, unforuantely you got punished this time, as they counter flashed you which caught you off-guard and then you tried peeking platform which unfortunately didn’t go your way. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice peek long and a solid kill, standing completely out in the open left of the blue bags isn’t a good idea as if you miss 1 shot you are basically dead. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round armour, nice B take and good job going back tunnels to backup your buddy fighting an enemy lowers but he ended up leaving you there after the enemies started trying to retake site you forgot about the enemy lowers which unforuantely ended up peeking you late as him buddies were on site. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, Solid pathing up short and good kills on the enemies site and car, unfortunately you were swiftly traded after killing the enemy car. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice attempt at peeking out middle unfortunately the enemy pushing lowers caught you off-guard and won this 50/50 fight. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, this is not ideal as the AK is significantly better than the galiel and you should try ot get it as often as you can, I like your confidence peeking the awper window this is usually not ideal as they have the advantage of holding, again peeking angles while moving forward instead of sideways, solid kill on the enemy peeking you from door unfortunately you got overrun by enemies peeking window and door. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice pathing out long but looking around while in pit almost got you in trouble, good idea to pickup teammates awp but you were trying to run over it instead of using E to pick it up.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>In general maybe like a 6, also its pretty late.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I just went wherever I felt I was needed.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Probably similar to what I said last time, at some points it felt good and at some other points bad, overall decent.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Sometimes on the enemy and my spray felt sometimes it was good.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Something I am still struggling with is taking peeks and how to spray and how to stop properly.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I don’t know exactly what the right stuff is all the time so I would say it was quite average.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>So I think in that game I felt like I didn’t manage money right and this caused me to not buy enough utility.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I’d say the callouts in general as a team were not the best and definitely could have been better.</li>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>13.Full buy, nice push into tunnels for a lot of good info, and solid push into middle allowing you to secure a good double kill, little bit of overaggression hunting down the awper alone in a 2v1 situation but fortunately, your teammate was able to clutch. W</p>
                    <p>14.Full buy, another push into tunnels allowing you to quickly flank T spawn, solid first kill trade on the enemy who killed your teammate, unfortunately, you walked into the next angle an enemy was holding which was towards T spawn side and this allow him to have a huge advantage in this engagement as he got to see you first. L</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice attempt peeking towards top middle this is generally quite a good fight at the usp is extremely good at long-range engagements but unfortunately and enemy managed to land a revolver shot on you which was quite lucky on their part. L</li>
                    <li>MP9, nice tunnels aggression this seems to be a reoccurring play for you from the previous game as well, good job coming up the catwalk and solid bursting on the enemy goose, you reloaded out in the open while still having enough ammo which could have easily gotten you punished, unfortunate spray on the second enemy was a slight whiff. L</li>
                    <li>Famas, a solid push into tunnels with a flash to get a kill on the enemy top tunnels and then falling back after the initial aggression, nearly caught reloading but fortunately, you were able to get the kill, but then going for the kill again while still having 14 bullets got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, push again into lowers and there was no one there this allowed you to flank T spawn and get a kill on an enemy who was AFK or had just thrown utility. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Again pushing lowers, good job trying to keep the headshot angle advantage, and falling back but when you left lowers you did not check middle and this could have easily gotten you killed if there was an enemy on short or top middle, solid rotation around back into tunnels from B and nice position lowers to hold for the aggression unfortunately I think you fell asleep on the angle as it took you a while in order to start shooting. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, sometimes shooting and moving which isn’t good and your spray control doesn’t look comfortable, because of how bad the famas is I always recommend closing the distance between you and the enemy with a famas imagine it as an upgraded smg instead of rifle. L</li>
                    <li>usp armour kit?, this buy is very weird and I do not recommend using this combo and combination with significantly more firepower would be Deagle + Bodarmour, although I would have recommended asking “Homo gang” for a drop instead as he had 6k in the bank, unfortunately, you decided to do the same play you have done the previous 5 rounds and the enemy expected you and was ready for you. L</li>
                    <li>Nova buy, lowers push again, your positioning was a good idea closing the distance with the shotgun but because you had done it so often before the enemies were expecting it and countered with a shotgun of their own, unfortunately, you missed your 2 shots and the enemy landed theirs. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round, Solid attempt at a B push, unfortunately, you died to the enemy peeking window I would have recommended trying to close the distance a little bit as the glock is stronger close range. L</li>
                    <li>galiel buy, good communication while rotating towards B and taking it, unforuantely you moved while shooting which threw off the accuracy of your bullets also whiffing your spray on the enemy shooting at your buddy caused you to die. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice bursting onto the enemy catwalk to secure the kill, unfortunately, you do not feel comfortable spraying and this forced you to stop shooting halfway through your burst to wait for the accuracy to reset and this ended up getting you killed by the enemies pushing behind you catwalk, W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid attempt at taking mid-control and good job spotting the enemy running up middle early but unfortunately because of your spray control you were not able to secure this kill on the enemy pushing you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement up the catwalk, unfortunately, you got a fright from an enemy lowers causing you to jump and then turn around, fortunately, the enemy also paniced and ending up missing all his shots allowing you to get the kill on him, still you are moving and shooting a lot and this is causing you to be inaccurate. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement up catwalk and a really good double entry onto A site with some clean bursting. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job peeking midd early and getting a solid entry pick, unfortunately, you peeked short alone and without utility and this allow the enemy short to see you quite easily and land a shot on you which you were already low from your previous fight. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>I was pretty comfortable.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I think sometimes I forget and don’t have good crosshair placement.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying and Never.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I think I need to improve on all of that.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I felt like in general and overall I think I rotated pretty well.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I don’t think I negatively impacted my teammates, I could probably use more utility and overall I think my utility was not great and not terrible.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I tried to give as many comms as I could in-game and although they are not always perfect I think they are decent.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Expanding early round CT playbook</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> Didn't really ahve any in-depth conversation, but I got carried pretty good and yes I would play with them again.</li>

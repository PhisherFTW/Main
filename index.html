                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/wH2Ce-plT0o">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t do repeat plays on CT side as it gives away your “positional advantage” and make it obvious for the enemies to counter you.</li>
                    <li>Don’t walk into fights whenever possible don’t walk in “danger” angles, these are angles where in your mind there is more than a 20% chance of an enemy being there.</li>
                    <li>Reloading in high conflict areas isn’t a good idea as it has a high chance of you getting killed while reloading, only try to reload when you are 100% safe from the enemy and ideally out of the distance where the enemy can hear you reload.</li>
                    <li>Whenever changing positions always keep your crosshair towards the position that poses the most threat to you even if this makes movement slightly more difficult as you could rather be looking at the danger than have to do a 180 turn to try get the kill.</li>
                    <li>For eco buys, don’t buy armour and default pistol (usp/glock) always upgrade your pistol which is your firepower and don’t buy head armour so the normal eco buy is: Deagle(or Tec9) + body armour.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>13.Full buy, nice push into tunnels for a lot of good info, and solid push into middle allowing you to secure a good double kill, little bit of overaggression hunting down the awper alone in a 2v1 situation but fortunately, your teammate was able to clutch. W</p>
                    <p>14.Full buy, another push into tunnels allowing you to quickly flank T spawn, solid first kill trade on the enemy who killed your teammate, unfortunately, you walked into the next angle an enemy was holding which was towards T spawn side and this allow him to have a huge advantage in this engagement as he got to see you first. L</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice attempt peeking towards top middle this is generally quite a good fight at the usp is extremely good at long-range engagements but unfortunately and enemy managed to land a revolver shot on you which was quite lucky on their part. L</li>
                    <li>MP9, nice tunnels aggression this seems to be a reoccurring play for you from the previous game as well, good job coming up the catwalk and solid bursting on the enemy goose, you reloaded out in the open while still having enough ammo which could have easily gotten you punished, unfortunate spray on the second enemy was a slight whiff. L</li>
                    <li>Famas, a solid push into tunnels with a flash to get a kill on the enemy top tunnels and then falling back after the initial aggression, nearly caught reloading but fortunately, you were able to get the kill, but then going for the kill again while still having 14 bullets got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, push again into lowers and there was no one there this allowed you to flank T spawn and get a kill on an enemy who was AFK or had just thrown utility. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Again pushing lowers, good job trying to keep the headshot angle advantage, and falling back but when you left lowers you did not check middle and this could have easily gotten you killed if there was an enemy on short or top middle, solid rotation around back into tunnels from B and nice position lowers to hold for the aggression unfortunately I think you fell asleep on the angle as it took you a while in order to start shooting. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, sometimes shooting and moving which isn’t good and your spray control doesn’t look comfortable, because of how bad the famas is I always recommend closing the distance between you and the enemy with a famas imagine it as an upgraded smg instead of rifle. L</li>
                    <li>usp armour kit?, this buy is very weird and I do not recommend using this combo and combination with significantly more firepower would be Deagle + Bodarmour, although I would have recommended asking “Homo gang” for a drop instead as he had 6k in the bank, unfortunately, you decided to do the same play you have done the previous 5 rounds and the enemy expected you and was ready for you. L</li>
                    <li>Nova buy, lowers push again, your positioning was a good idea closing the distance with the shotgun but because you had done it so often before the enemies were expecting it and countered with a shotgun of their own, unfortunately, you missed your 2 shots and the enemy landed theirs. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round, Solid attempt at a B push, unfortunately, you died to the enemy peeking window I would have recommended trying to close the distance a little bit as the glock is stronger close range. L</li>
                    <li>galiel buy, good communication while rotating towards B and taking it, unforuantely you moved while shooting which threw off the accuracy of your bullets also whiffing your spray on the enemy shooting at your buddy caused you to die. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice bursting onto the enemy catwalk to secure the kill, unfortunately, you do not feel comfortable spraying and this forced you to stop shooting halfway through your burst to wait for the accuracy to reset and this ended up getting you killed by the enemies pushing behind you catwalk, W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid attempt at taking mid-control and good job spotting the enemy running up middle early but unfortunately because of your spray control you were not able to secure this kill on the enemy pushing you. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement up the catwalk, unfortunately, you got a fright from an enemy lowers causing you to jump and then turn around, fortunately, the enemy also paniced and ending up missing all his shots allowing you to get the kill on him, still you are moving and shooting a lot and this is causing you to be inaccurate. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement up catwalk and a really good double entry onto A site with some clean bursting. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job peeking midd early and getting a solid entry pick, unfortunately, you peeked short alone and without utility and this allow the enemy short to see you quite easily and land a shot on you which you were already low from your previous fight. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>I was pretty comfortable.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I think sometimes I forget and don’t have good crosshair placement.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying and Never.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>I normally feel confident while spraying.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I think I need to improve on all of that.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I felt like in general and overall I think I rotated pretty well.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I don’t think I negatively impacted my teammates, I could probably use more utility and overall I think my utility was not great and not terrible.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I tried to give as many comms as I could in-game and although they are not always perfect I think they are decent.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Expanding early round CT playbook</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> Didn't really ahve any in-depth conversation, but I got carried pretty good and yes I would play with them again.</li>

            <div class="acc-content">

                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/dAdSDqMkJtQ">Video</a>
                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol FFA, solid crosshair placement but sometimes shooting slightly too quickly causing your deagle/usp to be inaccurate.</li>
                    <li>Rifle FFA, quick switching after every kill got you punished a few times, bursting is okay but sometimes you burst before your crosshair is on the enemy's head.</li>
                    <li>A lot of fights are taken when moving forward this causes you to be a little slow as you have to counter-strafe using the s key and I don’t think you are doing that as it looks like you are sliding to a stop, ideally 95% of your fights</li>
                    <li>Slight movement issues when moving around the map.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy body armour by default on both sides on Pistol round.</li>
                    <li>Only ever expose yourself to 1 angle at a time.</li>
                    <li>Whenever running long on Dust2 show your back towards long as you are running up to dodge any enemy flashes and throw a molly into the door-way to stop them from coming out.</li>
                    <li>When shooting at people boosting always shoot the one on the bottom at the one on top will drop causing them to be inaccurate longer allowing you to secure the kill on them.</li>
                    <li>Try to throw at little LOS (Line Of Sight) utility as possible as it only exposes you to danger, while you throw utility you could have probably thrown from a safer position.</li>
                    <li>Always try to position yourself close to cover so if you are caught slightly off-guard or flashed you have somewhere to fall back to I noticed a couple times on B you were exposed while throwing utility without any easily accessible cover.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ol>
                    <p>13.Full buy, nice push into tunnels for a lot of good info, and solid push into middle allowing you to secure a good double kill, little bit of overaggression hunting down the awper alone in a 2v1 situation but fortunately, your teammate was able to clutch. W</p>
                    <p>14.Full buy, another push into tunnels allowing you to quickly flank T spawn, solid first kill trade on the enemy who killed your teammate, unfortunately, you walked into the next angle an enemy was holding which was towards T spawn side and this allow him to have a huge advantage in this engagement as he got to see you first. L</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol Flash, a weird buy I usually recommend buying body armour as aim punch is terribly during fights also the fact that it only take 3 body shots to kill you without armour as opposed to 8+ with body armour, I recommend body armour especially at your current skill level as using utility to the same benefit level as having body armour will be incredibly difficult. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, nice positioning with the scout long, no enemies, nice attempt at backing up your teammates on B but by going window you are exposing yourself to 2 different angles whenever possible we want to avoid this and only leave you open to the angle you are ready for. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, unfortunately the T’s will always beat you out long if you try to get to pit, and your flash wasn’t enough to deter them, if you want to get into pit on a consistent basis without repercussions you need to understand the spawn you need and the molly that needs to be dropped, unfortunately they caught you while you were crossing to pit blind. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at doing damage on the enemy catwalk nearly securing a kill a small spray whiff caused you to miss, good peek onto site from short allowing you to get one kill but you couldn’t react to the awp goose. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, sitting in the middle of the open while dropping a flash into tunnels isn’t a good idea as you are throwing LOS (Line of sight) utility, which you only ever want to drop when absolutely necessary, solid rotate to where the bomb was dropped and nice peek long securing the final kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid positioning B with the headshot angle, again standing out in the open with the smoke to drop it tunnels which is slightly dangerous as an enemy could have easily had a timing, nice rotate towards A, bad timing to call for a boost as they could have peeked the long cross and this was dangerous, nice realization that the enemy was too far from the bomb to kill your defuser and calling for your buddy to defuse, solid kill on the last enemy middle. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, again standing out in the open, unforuantely you got punished this time, as they counter flashed you which caught you off-guard and then you tried peeking platform which unfortunately didn’t go your way. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice peek long and a solid kill, standing completely out in the open left of the blue bags isn’t a good idea as if you miss 1 shot you are basically dead. W</li>
                    <li>T pistol round armour, nice B take and good job going back tunnels to backup your buddy fighting an enemy lowers but he ended up leaving you there after the enemies started trying to retake site you forgot about the enemy lowers which unforuantely ended up peeking you late as him buddies were on site. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, Solid pathing up short and good kills on the enemies site and car, unfortunately you were swiftly traded after killing the enemy car. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice attempt at peeking out middle unfortunately the enemy pushing lowers caught you off-guard and won this 50/50 fight. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, this is not ideal as the AK is significantly better than the galiel and you should try ot get it as often as you can, I like your confidence peeking the awper window this is usually not ideal as they have the advantage of holding, again peeking angles while moving forward instead of sideways, solid kill on the enemy peeking you from door unfortunately you got overrun by enemies peeking window and door. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice pathing out long but looking around while in pit almost got you in trouble, good idea to pickup teammates awp but you were trying to run over it instead of using E to pick it up.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>In general maybe like a 6, also its pretty late.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I just went wherever I felt I was needed.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Probably similar to what I said last time, at some points it felt good and at some other points bad, overall decent.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Sometimes on the enemy and my spray felt sometimes it was good.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Something I am still struggling with is taking peeks and how to spray and how to stop properly.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I don’t know exactly what the right stuff is all the time so I would say it was quite average.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>So I think in that game I felt like I didn’t manage money right and this caused me to not buy enough utility.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I’d say the callouts in general as a team were not the best and definitely could have been better.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I think, I try to get a gameplan at the beginning of each and every round.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>The teammates I queued with I liked.</li>

                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick switching after kills isn’t a good idea as it keeps getting you in trouble while you wait for your gun to shoot again.</li>
                    <li>Currently sometimes while spraying aiming at the body and waiting for the bullets to rise from the spray pattern.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid taking unnecessary damage whenever possible if from enemy util or fall damage as this small amount of damage could lead to you losing a fight you would have otherwise won.</li>
                    <li>Avoid throwing LOS (Line Of Sight) utility whenever possible as it is extremely dangerous for little reward and usually there is a better way of throwing that particular piece of utility, shooting the enemy will nearly always do more damage than any grenade or molly you are about to throw.</li>
                    <li>Focus on syncing up your movement and aiming as it seems sometimes you are ready to start shooting but your movement isn’t quite there or you move into a good angle without being ready to shoot yet.</li>
                    <li>If you get a decoy or buy one, I recommend using it as a fake flash instead of just dropping it in spawn.</li>
                    <li>Always buy head armour on T side, as a rule because not having head armour allows your full loadout to get killed by one pistol shot.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round,buy,notes,W/L
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol armour, B rush, good job not pushing through the late molly, a tiny bit of unnecessary damage, on the molly taking 1 tick of damage, bad positioning towards back platform as you are artificially creating distance between you and the enemy and during pistol round you want to close the distance with the Glock, although you managed to catch the enemy window off guard securing a kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement catwalk, unfortunately, the enemy was running around the corner which caught you off-guard and he was super close range which allowed him to catch you off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice instant trade on the enemy catwalk, nice flash into the A site, although when going for the peek your preaim and movement were off and this allowed the exposed enemy to get back onto site, and on your repeek, you threw LOS utility which was dangerous and could have gotten you killed it also didn’t land on site which is where you wanted it to land, then you peeked out catwalk while having low bullets from your previous engagement which led to you running out of bullets during the fight. L</li>
                    <li>CZ, nice dink on the enemy catwalk and good positioning short to catch anyone rotating from A site, good patience, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice middle smoke, although you were challenging an awper at long range which gave him the advantage in this fight leading to him winning. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid long take and good reaction to get the trade on the enemy long and nice patience to wait for the regression and get the kill on him, although your positioning and movement were off during this round, nice attempt at peeking into long house but it wasn’t executed properly which meant when you got into the fight your crosshair placement was off. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid B take although no utility, unfortunate timing on the enemy peeking window getting the kill on you with a scout. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, a wasted decoy in spawn, I recommend using it as a fake flash or dropping it on the bomb after its planted for a chance of doing a little bit of damage, solid kill on the enemy pushing uppers from lower stairs. W</li>
                    <li>Pistol armour, solid B positioning and once your teammate pushed tunnels it become obvious that there was no one there causing you to rotate to CT to be accessible anywhere. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no head armour this is questionable as I think this is what got you punished on the previous round, having no head armour basically turns any pistol or smg into a AK, so you have to be very weary, good job securing a kill on the enemy middle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, still no head armour,nice job dropping a molly long, although I do recommend hiding behind the wall before moving into the pit, fortunately, no one was challenging this round, solid damage onto the enemy around middle but unfortunately dropping a nade on your teammates head wasn’t great. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job dropping the molly long but this time you nearly got caught while crossing, this is why I recommend dropping the molly and hiding behind the long corner wall and then repeeking while rotating from pit to A site you didn’t keep your crosshair glued to the most dangerous angle which was long and this got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice peek towards long, although unfortunately, I think you fell asleep a little bit, interesting reposition to behind the car, although when on low hp I don’t recommend this position and a slightly better position would have been site or CT as the enemies were pushing up short and long. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice quick lowers push, and flank through long spawn, solid kill on an enemy top middle, I will show you the god off-angle when holding long house from either side, unfortunately, they clear the close left as they are coming out long. L</li>
                    <li>CZ, when playing with the CZ its a wild weapon and I recommend closing the distance as much as possible and shooting in short 2-bullet bursts when at medium and tapping at long range. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, solid rotation to A, no action. W</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Pretty comfortable although desk is a bit high.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>Felt pretty good, and playing long has felt better, although my spray and aim feels off.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I think my crosshair placement is half the time good and not good the other half.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Sometimes and recently with my spray I don’t feel confident.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I am not thinking about any of the peeks I am taking or about my peeks or when I peek just instinctually, It felt decent</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I think my rotations are pretty good although my positioning isn’t great after repositioning.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I definitely naded my teammate, but other than that I am not sure.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>Its probably something I can work on it was kind of mediocre. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I put myself in a position where I could get twice as many kills, but trying to get better aim and better spray control.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>I had some good teammates, </li>

                <h3>FFA DM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>First bullet accuracy isn’t super strong, some more focused practice on that would be great, also sometimes shooting before your crosshair is on the enemy.</li>
                    <li>Getting comfortable with the spraying for the head technique and idea</li>
                    <li>Over-reliance on crouching while spraying making you an easy target.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>CT pistol always take far-range engagements when possible and try to have cover close by as the CT pistols don’t have a lot of ammo.</li>
                    <li>Whenever buying SMGs always buy at least body armour if not full armour as taking aim punch while having an SMG is not ideal and getting killed in 3 bullets while spending.</li>
                    <li>Focus on lining up your crosshair on the enemy before shooting especially if you are behind them at this will give you more of an opportunity to multi-kill.</li>
                    <li>Use walking to your advantage more as currently you are running in a lot of places and this information is given to the enemies allowing them to be more ready for your engagement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>Map: Vertigo</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, bad position top boxes middle fortunately you didn’t get punished but I recommend standing at an angle that is long range and that allows you to easily fall back, good job falling back and securing a kill. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9, no armour, this is a bad idea especially when you have $2400 in the bank as the aim punch you would be taking is a lot, unfortunately, this was the case in the fight against the enemy midde as he shot you your crosshair jumped up a lot and it takes less bullets to kill you without armour. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at using a 1-way smoke in middle nearly securing 2 kills, unfortunately, the one enemy realized your positioning and managed to kill you. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, interesting position close unfortunately you made your position known early and this allowed the enemies to counter you and for you to lose your positional advantage. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice headshot positioning on B looking into ramp but unfortunately, the enemies running up ramp checked that angle and won the duel. L</li>
                    <li>dualies, basically a full save, good job getting a quick flank but unfortunately because you were running the whole way the enemies could hear you flanking and were ready. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice early ramp aggression after realizing there was no one there, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, ramp smoke fail, nice movement and peeking up skinny, but pulling out your flash skinny was dangerous and it gave away your intentions, nice rotation behind the enemy although you started spraying before your crosshair was on the enemy this led to you whiffing your spray and the enemy peeking back into you and then you decided to reload while still vulnerable to a repeek and you had 8 bullets left in the magazine. L</li>
                    <li>T-side pistol armour, nice kill on the enemy ontop of site, unfortunate timing on the second peek as you got double-peeked while short and ran out of ammo. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid kill on the enemies pushing middle and nice job falling back and holding behind this allowed you to secure a kil on the flank, good job attempting to get into an off angle but because you ran there in middle the enemy CT hear you and knew where you were. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, peeking skinny while walking forward nearly got you killed but good crosshair placement to secure the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, solid movement and positioning up B stairs, solid trade kill on the enemy behind aircon. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, unfortunate whiff spray on the enemy peeking from A site while you were short. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, peeking B solo very wide and quite unfocused allowed you to be thrown off when taking this first fight on stairs. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning looking into middle but unfortunately when you got flashed you didn’t take cover and this allowed the enemy to land an easy short on you from middle. L</li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Comfortable</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I honestly don’t know the map that well so I don’t have any preferred positions.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Almost never.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Very Bad.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>Man everything in that game just felt terrible.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I died a lot so I don’t think I really made it to content a lot of bombs</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I am sure probably not and I think the only utility I can remember was middle smoke and the attempt at a ramp smoke</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I feel like I had decent callouts for my teammates.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>I think having a better gameplan going into the game.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Pretty quiet game.</li>

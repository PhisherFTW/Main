                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If using utility on Pistol rounds, use reactive utility instead of proactive utility, this will increase the chances of the utility having a meaningful impact on the round.</li>
                    <li>Make sure your utility lands where you expect it before relying on it to keep you safe for example a Molly/Smoke.</li>
                    <li>Always try to play within the optimal range of the weapon you are currently using although you might get kills in other situations by strictly playing within the optimal range of your weapon you increase you chances of winning every fight you take.</li>
                    <li>In a few rounds you threw LOS (Line of sight) utility which nearly and did get you punished a few times, whenever possible don't throw utility while being exposed to a potentially dangerous angle.</li>
                    <li>Try not to tunnel vision on players in certain positions as you play against better players they will use this tactic the bait and switch constantly, learning to manage your aggression when there is seemingly a free kill can help you win rounds.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medium to long-distance spraying is a bit rough, this skill is crucial to the vast majority of CS as spraying is the most effective shooting method for the majority of duels.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Molly, nice idea to molly ramp, but I would have recommended going with the standard body armour as it provides several advantages and is difficult to waste, whereas if you buy utility which is easy to waste you are left with nothing after its been used, good retake attempt but you were a bit early in the retake when you went for it which made it harder for your teammate to trade you, also the fact you had no body armour meant you got aim punch as you jumped out. L</li>
                    <li>P250, good positioning under palace and a nice attempt at using the headshot angle but unfortunately they mollied you out which put you in an awkward position and you accidentally got caught on firebox. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility towards ramp and middle, good confident peek into ramp from stairs, and good reaction to your teammate's communication about the enemies being middle and good job securing a nice double kill although you did have to do larger flicks you managed to pull them off. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job smoking palace although you were exposing your back to it before the smoke bloomed, nice kill on the player palace going for the prefire, good aggression onto the player tetris, and nice attempt in the 1v1. L</li>
                    <li>P250, good job knowing you can pop the window smoke but this wasn’t the right situation as when you peeked 4 players were watching you with AKs at a range significantly outside the optimal range of the p250. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job rotating into the open position after the B player left catwalk, really nice shots onto the bench player to secure that kill, unfortunately you got spammed from the chair as you were slowly falling back. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice attempt at going for the window shot, and good rotation into a high-impact position in the market, fantastic job securing the first kill although if you had instantly peeked the second you probably would have caught him off-guard by giving him time to repeek he was 100% ready for your engagement. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice try peeking middle to assist your short player but unfortunately, it seems like you burst and after your 4th shot didn’t kill him you paused for your accuracy to reset and then he killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunately, your teammate's calls were slightly off as the enemy under was already in middle, so when he peeked he caught you off-guard and won this duel. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good middle flash to try to delay the short take, really good usage of a smoke break to peek up short and secure that kill, good retake and nice utility to prevent the short player from pushing, and great ninja defuse, fantastic overall round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunately in an attempt to get the bottom connector smoke, you threw LOS utility which caused you to be defenceless when the actual enemy came to peek. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, good job dodging the palace flash, unfortunately, the enemy palace managed to hone in on your exact positioning so when he went for the peek with the awp he had a huge advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Smoke flashes, the utility buy from you is extremely generous, good window smoke and solid flash assist, good positioning in apps to hold the flank and secure the kill, and a really important kill on the defuser, good job winning this round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice connector smoke, and a good flash-out window, unfortunately as you came out to fight the enemy close van he had backup on site, which your teammate quickly traded. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good middle smoke unfortunate fight through the connector smoke as the enemy won this fight. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good window smoke, solid short nade, unfortunate fight in the window against the pistol getting into his optimal range. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice window smoke, good kill on the enemy short but your peek wasn’t focused as your reaction was delayed but you made up for it with good crosshair placement, good job planting the bomb. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good middle smoke and flash peek, you are a lot more careful of short this round, and when you went up connector you were ready for the peek short, really good peek against the last enemy connector. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good default util, weird smoke in middle call they could push lowers, unfortunate timing as your teammate died to window you couldn’t trade him, couldn’t hear the guy dropping down from short who killed you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, default util, nice attempt at making a play into the connector and after you got through I would have liked to have seen you focus in and play it slightly safer as you also had the bomb which the enemies saw and tried to defend. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, small miss on the connector smoke, good job getting the trade on the enemy top palace but you were quite exposed which led to you getting killed by the enemy stais. W</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Comfortable</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>Connector is not my preferred position and I usually play towards A site to triple.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Sometimes on the enemy.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>mildly confident in flicking and also wiffed a few sprays.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I tried to change up the peeking styles.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>My movement I think was okay, people were randomly swapping position on CT side so I felt forced to move.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>I don’t think I hurt anyone, although I did die with my nade out in connector.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>I think my communication was generally good, I was just flustered in the start saying the wrong thing.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Not have grenades out when I am in an impact position.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>No.</li>

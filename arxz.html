                <h3>Focus areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buy body armour on pistol rounds, as these are very important rounds to try to win, and body armour is probably the best thing you can buy for 3 main reasons: 1) Having body armour reduces your aim punch—this is your character flinching when he gets shot, causing your crosshair to jump, which makes shooting very difficult. 2) Having body armour can significantly increase the amount of damage you can sustain to the stomach/chest; instead of being killed with 3 stomach shots, it can take between 6/7 shots to kill you like that. 3) Unlike utility, which is very easy to waste, you can’t really waste armour like you can with utility, and if you play well enough, you can carry it into the following round and make it cheaper for you.</li>
                    <li>Second round buys, if you win the first round, you put absolutely everything into the second round because you will always have an overall better buy than the enemy team, and this will give you a good advantage during this round. But if you don’t buy seriously, you can accidentally negate this advantage; obvious ways of doing this is just not using your money.</li>
                    <li>LOS utility, this was quite a common problem. This stands for Line Of Sight utility, and it's when you throw utility from out in the open and you can see where it lands, which isn’t usually good because that means an enemy could technically peek you while you have utility out.</li>
                    <li>During light buy/save rounds, your primary objective should be how can I do the most damage I can possibly do while spending as little as possible, and usually, this will be with an upgraded pistol like a p250/tec/fiveseven/cz. These weapons pack a huge punch for their price and at least give you a chance to secure a kill against a fully equipped opponent if you position yourself properly.</li>
                    <li>Optimal range, choose your position based on the weapon you can afford. If you can only afford an SMG/Shotgun, do not play them in the same position you would with a Rifle/Awp. This is the same for upgraded pistols; you want to play super close range in your first engagement for Upgraded pistols/SMGS and Shotguns due to accuracy fall off with range and damage fall off.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Often shooting before crosshair is locked on the enemy.</li>
                </ul>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Nuke</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol, didn’t buy body armour, this is extremely dangerous as three pistol body shots are all that is required to kill you compared to about 6-9 shots if you do have body armour, good job securing the kill on the enemy heaven before he could land a second body shot on you. W</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, this is a bit of a weird buy considering you still had $1.5k left in the bank, I would have recommended spending this on utility and a secondary to help assist close range, unfortunately, you were forced into a fight with your Glock but fortunately, the enemy didn’t have body armour so you were able to quickly secure the kill, good job switching to a teammates weapon and getting a followup kill on an enemy dropping vents. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nearly throwing some LOS utility mouth which could have been dangerous but fortunately, your teammate dropped the utility first, small spray whiffs on the enemy running along rafters, this prompted you to change positions which was a good call going hut and nice confident peek out from hut killing the last enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement into Secret but unfortunately dropping some LOS utility onto stairs was quite dangerous as the enemy could have easily peeked you, and then peeking the next angle doing a W strafe which is very uncomfortable to counter-strafe causing a delay in you shooting and thus giving the enemy the advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, nice trade attempt on the enemy ramp unfortunately they were ready for your peek with the mac-10 and managed to get the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice peek mouth from opening door and good usage of the angle to try not to over peek but unfortunate timing when clearing top hut getting you punished by the guy bottom hut whose position you already knew. L</li>
                    <li>save with utility? interesting buy not usually seen as most players will opt for an upgraded pistol to do more damage, nice peek on the enemy on site doing a ton of damage with the glock although the enemy should have killed you fortunately your teammate managed to secure the kill and you were able to use your smoke to smoke mouth but wasted the flash when you died, accidental movement exposed you to heaven which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement outside and really nice entries onto A securing a double entry kill on the people on A. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, good job following your group towards ramp unfortunately you got full whited by your teammate Flash Ramp and this allowed the enemy flank to get close without you properly hearing him and getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice confident peeking into Hut and smart choice to fall off once the enemy was peeking, really good angle top rafters into Hut, nice try rushing down ramp to plant on B, unfortunately, an enemy was chasing you and as soon as you started planting he peeked and killed you. L</li>
                    <li>full save, A rush, solid pathing through hut, during these kinds of rounds when you have $3.2K I would recommend upgrading to at least a p250 which is like 10 time better against opponents with guns than a Glock. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid attempt at taking outside but the enemies quickly realized you were not in A main and they flanked to top Silo and got a triple kill on you guys. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job holding hut although when you heard him drop down from the rafters you should have realized there was a chance he would peek into Hut and unfortunate timing you pulled out a piece of utility as soon as he peeked. W</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, interesting smg to go with its fallen out of meta since the nerf but if used properly it can be quite effective unforuatnely the first engagement you go against back blue container was outside the optimal range of the SMG and this made it so you took a ton of damage, later on in the round as you pushed mouth you got shot in the back. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, trying to push hut but your teammate fell back this caused you to fall back to A main which you were unfortunately flanked from Outside and killed. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol, again no buy, really really nice shot on the enemy sprinting out Squeaky, solid damage on the second but unfortunately you were close range to the glock giving him the advantage in that fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, outside push, on full save rounds to be most effective solo I recommend picking a position that allows your first engagement to be super close range as this is the easiest range in order to get a double dink which is what you need to secure a kill, unfortunately your positioning outside during the rush when the peeked wasn’t close enough for this effect to give you any sort of advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly squeaky door, LOS utility towards Squeaky which was very dangerous and could have easily gotten you killed if the enemy got the timing, good flank through A main nearly completely catching one enemy ramp unfortunate spray whiff caused it not to kill, solid kill on the retake B. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, small movement mistake causing you to take 18 damage dropping from heaven this turns a galiel into an AK or a p250 headshot into an instant kill, nice angle into hut and good reaction time allowing you to kill the first enemy without taking any damage, nearly caught off-guard when dropping out of hut, fortunately, you had enough time to pull your gun back out after you heard the enemy chasing you with a pistol, solid second kill. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, nice molly into Squeaky door, and good smoke into hut, nice flank through A main and good kill on the enemy ramp unfortunately leaving you in a 1v2 situation, good attempt but unfortunately, you got double peeked. L</li>
                    <li>MP5 buy, bad positioning vents with the SMG as your first engagement against the enemy secret would have been outside the optimal range, good job falling back and nice movement up the ladder, solid peeks onto B allowing you to secure 2 kills on unsuspecting enemies and a very lucky but nice kill on the third enemy who was shooting you with the AK. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good quick rotation down to B as your teammate communicated it, nice peek out the door to kill the enemy planting and nice preaiming for the peek on the railing above B, unfortunately peeking slightly agro and getting killed while your teammate behind you was being shot at. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice movement and peeking into A main, unfortunately, the enemy in A main was slightly aware of the possible push but because you jiggled it, that gave him the information and allowed him to adjust for your final peek which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, solid molly ramp and nice flash and push into A main although a little bit loud as this prompted the enemy inside hut to prefire your peek from the vending machine. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, dangerous smoke towards squeaky which counts as LOS utility as they could have peeked you while you had utility out, weird reposition timing nearly getting you killed but fortunately you were able to spray the first one, and during your reload the enemy heard you and decided to taze you. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, when you have 2 players on Hut one must watch either side in this situation both were watching door which allowed an enemy to get out hut and this nearly got you both killed, good adjustment and change of position but you still had around 15 bullets left and this would have been enough to get a kill but this prompted you to reload and thus alerted the enemy door to your position allowing him to shoot you through the door. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, really nice quick push into A main completely catching the one enemy outside off-guard but their communication must have been bad as you were able to secure a second one for free, good job playing the 1v1 like a champ and not going overly agro. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, nice positioning on A site and good kill on the enemy Hut giving you control of the bomb, dangerous LOS utility towards mouth, unfortunately were not expecting the peek heaven which got you killed while reloading the awp. L</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimal range, this is the term I use to describe the range at which weapons are most deadly, for example AWP and Scout are best at long distance, Upgraded pistols/SMGS and Shotguns are best at super close range, I notice a few times during these matches you would often take fights outside of the optimal range when you were playing with Upgraded pistols and SMGS often making these fights a lot more difficult and in a lot of the cases being the main cause of your death.</li>
                    <li>Going for “unwinnable” retakes, I put that in quotes because although technically its winnable, its incredibly difficult situations like 2v4/2v5 situations when the enemies have the weaponry advantage / Positional advantage and the Time advantage, making the retake incredibly unlikely if they play at all decent.</li>
                    <li>Going for slightly obvious peeks, at times you were killed instantly because of the way you peeked an angle and this can be prevented by imagining what kind of peek the enemy is expecting you to do and then doing something different to that, which will give you a huge advantage in the fight and often throw off the enemies crosshair placement, if he is expecting a normal peek maybe do a jiggle and then a wide swing to draw in his crosshair.</li>
                    <li>Be wary of mollies at range, as enemies can often sit behind it making it very difficult for you to see them but easy for them to see you, this got you killed once but still something to take note of.</li>
                    <li>LOS utility, throwing potentially dangerous utility that leaves you exposed often with you seeing where it lands and thus allowing for an enemy to peek you on a timing while you have utility in your hand.</li>
                    <li>When on T side, be careful of taking unnecessary damage, because if your hp drops to 92, this allows M4’s to 1 hit headshot you, and this turns them into basically a better AK.</li>
                    <li>CT pistol round, I always recommend armour 99.5% of the time, this is for a number of reasons but the main ones are: 1) Having body armour reduces aim punch which in turn makes aiming easier and will probably result in you getting more kills 2) Body armour increases the number of body shots you can take significantly from 3 → 6/7 bodyshot which is a huge increase 3) You can’t “waste” body armour the same way you can miss a flash or a grenade and do nothing with it, if you play well enough it will even come with you into the following round making it cheaper!</li>
                    <li>Light buys, you want to do the most amount of damage for the least amount of money and you will not get that with utility the vast majority of the time unless you land grenades at the feet of multiple enemies it will almost always be better to choose a p250 or something similar as I always say bullets usually do more damage than utility.</li>
                </ul>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Ancient</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, solid positioning donut, good aggression into middle after the initial contact but a little slow when pushing up, nice angle clearing in halls, and good job getting out, first fight is a little awkward but your teammate managed to get the kill unfortunately also killing you. L</li>
                    <li>MP7 buy, aggressive angle deep into A main slightly outside the optimal range of the SMG, if you had faced an upgraded pistol or a rifle on this angle they would have had the advantage, good attempt at saving but unfortunately in the last 5 seconds, you got into an engagement and killed. L</li>
                    <li>Nade, nice nade stack middle, good job not overcommitting to a fight in tunnels and well done to get a weapon but in this situation, you should have saved, it was still a 2v3, while you were smoked out and had no kit with the bomb very close to exploding, unfortunately, you committed and got instantly killed coming through the smoke. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice initial kill on the enemy peeking tunnels but this angle is slightly overly aggressive, and solid damage to the second enemy but you moved in between bursts which made it difficult for you to secure the kill even though you dinked the enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid positioning behind the box on A, going for the retake in a 2v5 situation is not worth it as they have the, numbers advantage, weaponry advantage, positional advantage and bomb timer advantage, making this an extremely uncomfortable situation. L</li>
                    <li>p250, super long-range angle on B into ramp from short this is good with a scout or AWP not really a p250, good reaction when you realized that the enemy was flank and immediately pushed forward and got a gun, unfortunately, you didn’t play this round with your team and ended up giving the enemy 2 1v1 fights, which he won. L</li>
                    <li>MP5, nice dodging and weaving around Donut after the enemies tried to flush you out but unfortunately your push left after the molly faded was what he was expecting and this allowed him to quickly secure the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice molly into Ramp and a solid smoke and position in tunnels, bad peek timing on your flash completely blinding you, unfortunately, left in a 1v3 situation, I would have to recommend saving and now next round you will have no utility. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting change of pace going hyper-aggressive into A main, and a fantastic flank, but your trigger discipline just wasn’t there as you were behind 3 enemies, I would have recommended lining up the ones that were moving the least and move from most threatening to least threatening in terms of probability they turn around and shoot you instantly, nice late peek mid to secure the last kill middle. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, good idea to Molly middle to prevent the push through the middle but then peeking behind it allowed them to know you were peeking and because of the flames it made it very difficult to properly spot the enemy getting you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice smoke and flash combo into the middle allowing you to get an early middle kill, good thinking to swap weapons and play around the middle smoke like that, and a very nice second kill on the enemy A, small spray whiff on the third enemy coming out of temple. W</li>
                    <li>MP7, nice utility set into the middle with a smoke and nade middle and a flash B, perfect positioning with the MP7 close to the smoke, nice movement through tunnels and good reaction to touch the bomb, but with an SMG I would have recommended getting closer to the enemy. W</li>
                    <li>T side, nothing, I would always recommend at least buying body armour, as it makes it so you go from taking 3 body shots to kill, to 6 or 7, and it reduces your aim punch significantly, really nice double kill on the enemies pushing in from CT, unfortunately, you ran out of ammo and were left in a 1v2 situation which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 you didn’t trust your initial reaction, but thankfully your teammate assisted you with the enemy behind the small box, a small spray whiff on the enemy Donut, but your team managed to pull off the B fake and go A. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid flash onto B but I don’t think you called it out causing 2 of your teammates to be quite blind on the entry, slightly dangerous LOS utility from alley, solid kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid kill on the enemy back alley, although slight overaggression on your part pushing past alley as the smoke was about to fade from tunnels, and throwing a LOS flash got you punished by an enemy peeking back alley. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, didn’t expect an enemy to already be posted on you cave, causing you to be caught while pulling out your AK and unfortunately getting you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, kind of running into middle with your knife out and getting shot at, this left you confused and unfortunately, by the time you and your teammates figured out the position of the enemy this got you killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting molly towards back alley unfortunately no one was able to follow it up so it wasn’t super useful, and then you were agro-peeked from middle while lower B long. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid attempt at going A, but you wasted your molly platform, and your pathing out A wasn’t ideal and unfortunately you got caught off-guard twice which led to you dying to an enemy peeking Donut. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, your pathing and positioning when peeking middle with your teammate wasn’t within the Goldilocks zone for getting a trade, when falling back make sure you are always looking at the potentially dangerous angle you don’t want to get shot in the back while falling back, great kill on the shotgun tunnels, and a solid followup on the enemy back alley, nice 1v2 kills perfect positioning and round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nearly caught throwing LOS utility on A when out and nearly killed from upper B while flashing into Middle, unfortunately, you got double-peeked which led to you dying. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid smoke into DIG, although dangerous LOS molly into jungle as you were peeked from Donut, fortunately, you were not killed, good job forcing the enemy to get off the bomb and fortunately he didn’t have a kit. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, throwing LOS utility as you are running up ramp nearly gets you killed and then solid damage onto the enemy alley, and good followup nade but you peeking from A site into alley was a little dangerous. W</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Map: Inferno</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol, nothing, unfortunately chilling in the triangle of death got you down to 38 hp from a single grenade and due to not having any body armour, it took 2 body shots to kill you. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, solid molly banana and good follow-up grenade allowing you to instantly kill one with utility and kill the enemy pushing down banana, also good job clearing your angles as you took over banana killing the enemy hiding sandbags. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, small amount of damage taken from your own utility leaving you on 92hp, although this turns an M4 into a better AK, so be wary of taking random small amounts of damage, nice kill on the enemy arches with the mac-10 and solid bomb plant on A default. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, good kill on the enemy top banana with utility although your consistent jiggling allowed the deagles to continue lining up optimal shots and it finally gave them enough opportunities and they killed you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression into top banana, although when pulling out utility it looks like you were confused and didn’t really know what you wanted to do, pushing towards A nice flash into middle and solid peek onto the enemy lane, unfortunate engagement against the enemy library that didn’t go your way. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, chilling against in the rectangle of death leading to you having 23 damage from utility, really nice kill on the enemy top banana, and solid positioning family after plant. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement into top banana but unfortunately you took a lot of damage from the molly leaving you on 27 hp, and due to the low hp this makes your first engagement incredibly difficult to win. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, accidentally nading your teammate for 17 but I could see what you were trying to do throwing the nade over the wall, good job getting bomb down but there was an enemy close who did a lot of damage to you, you decided to stay first orange which is exactly where you planted the bomb allowing for an easy preaim for the enemy peeking you from church. W</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, good job waiting out the prefire timing on the bottom banana smoke this allowed you to get past safely, good job rotating up to apartments, and smart decision to switch from awp to m4 in apps, but reloading while exposed to hallway wasn’t the right call and as soon as he heard you reload it was over for you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice damage on the enemy top banana, dangerous peek into CT and then an even more dangerous play pushing into tree, but good thing they didn’t check it and this allowed you to secure a free kill on the enemy CT, then peeking deep CT while on extremely low hp hunting for the last enemy was a little dangerous and somehow you survived. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really good utility up banana, good idea rotating but unfortunately as you were moving up middle you decided to reload as the smoke faded allowing an agro enemy top middle to land a kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, very nice quick trade on the enemy top banana, really good job trying to keep one B late which you did delaying the retake and a good job on the late flank, allowing you to completely catch the last enemy off-guard on site. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol, grenade and decoy? interesting combo, I would have recommended just body armour, as you immediately felt what no armour did as you had a lot of aim punch and instantly went down to 44 hp from body shots. L</li>
                    <li>Grenade, nice attempt at an agro peek unfortunately they dropped a molly and nade top banana and instantly killed you and your teammate. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a bit of a waste of a flash as you didn’t peek off of it and it was your only piece of utility, good job getting one kill but I think if you would have cleared right first and then left you could have left with a double or triple kill. L</li>
                    <li>p250, dangerous peek down middle with a p250 as any gun is probably going to be better at that range, better reposition onto A site close left box, playing a close range angle, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at a utility set but 3 of the 4 were a waste, the molly was good the nade second middle was too early, the smoke middle didn’t do its job and you didn’t peek properly with the flash, good job securing a kill. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven, agro peek down middle but then you started second-guessing and got peeked by an enemy from Banana who killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility combo down banana with the molly and nade but the flash wasn’t necessary as fast enemies were able to skip that, and that is what happens as you got instantly peeked after dropping your utility and the enemy knew your exact position. L</li>
                    <li>Molly grenade, nice utility very little firepower, solid dink on the enemy banana allowing your teammate to secure a kill, and for you to pick up the weapon, but unfortunately you didn’t hear the enemy running behind you top banana and this is what got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>MP5, nice using the new angle mini, but it isn’t ideal for SMGs, good rotate to B and fantastic job letting them pass you in the slow allowing for you to secure a double kill against full-bought T’s with an SMG, although you should have saved at this point as the bomb was already ticked far along and there were still 2 enemies alive. L</li>
                    <li>AUG buy, nice positioning in Apps allowing you to kill an enemy second middle, really nice peek against the enemy top banana, but still, you were left in a 1v3 situation, I would have recommended saving. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice use of the decoy as a fake flash and I like the change of pace and aggression peeking down banana, nearly allowing you to line up two enemies, but your spray wasn’t quite on your side and this let to you missing it. L</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>How comfortable were you in the poistions you played? <br>I wasn’t comfortable on B and ancient isn’t one of my favourite maps, I like A on inferno a lot. </li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>I felt like my crosshair was somtimes on the enemy. </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during the game? <br>Nah I didn’t feel confident in my flicks, Sprays felt terrible on main rifles AK and M4.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I usually just swing it and hope.</li>
                    <li>How did you movement and rotations feel? <br>I feel like I rotated on time, I might have bumped into walls or made noise.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>Bought enough, but sometimes it went where I didn’t mean to, some of it might have negatively impacted my teammates.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br>Mic doesn’t work, I would recommend pinging with middle mouse to indicate enemies or planting or positions.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br>Crosshair placement.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>I didn’t mind them. </li>
